      "Lesson: Algorithms The polymorphic algorithms described here are pieces of reusable functionality provided by the Java platform. All of them come from the Collections class, and all take the form of static methods whose first argument is the collection on which the operation is to be performed. The great majority of the algorithms provided by the Java platform operate on List instances, but a few of them operate on arbitrary Collection instances. This section briefly describes the following algorithms: Sorting Shuffling Routine Data Manipulation Searching Composition Finding Extreme Values\n",
      "Sorting The Collections.sort algorithm reorders a List so that its elements are in ascending order according to an ordering relationship. Two forms of the operation are provided. The simple form takes a List and sorts it according to its elements' natural ordering. If you're unfamiliar with the concept of natural ordering, read the Object Ordering section. The Collections.sort operation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithm that is fast and stable: Fast: It is guaranteed to run in n log(n) time and runs substantially faster on nearly sorted lists. Empirical tests showed it to be as fast as a highly optimized quicksort. A quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable and doesn't guarantee n log(n) performance. Stable: It doesn't reorder equal elements. This is important if you sort the same list repeatedly on different attributes. If a user of a mail program sorts the inbox by mailing date and then sorts it by sender, the user naturally expects that the now-contiguous list of messages from a given sender will (still) be sorted by mailing date. This is guaranteed only if the second sort was stable.\n",
      "Sorting - part 2 The following trivial program prints out its arguments in lexicographic (alphabetical) order. import java.util.*; public class Sort { public static void main(String[] args) { List<String> list = Arrays.asList(args); Collections.sort(list); System.out.println(list); } } Let's run the program. % java Sort i walk the line The following output is produced. [i, line, the, walk] The program was included only to show you that algorithms really are as easy to use as they appear to be. The second form of Collections.sort takes a Comparator in addition to a List and sorts the elements with the Comparator . Suppose you want to print out the anagram groups from our earlier example in reverse order of size ? largest anagram group first. The example that follows shows you how to achieve this with the help of the second form of the Collections.sort method.\n",
      "Sorting - part 3 Recall that the anagram groups are stored as values in a Map , in the form of List instances. The revised printing code iterates through the Map 's values view, putting every List that passes the minimum-size test into a List of List s. Then the code sorts this List , using a Comparator that expects List instances, and implements reverse size-ordering. Finally, the code iterates through the sorted List , printing its elements (the anagram groups). The following code replaces the printing code at the end of the main method in the Anagrams example. // Make a List of all anagram groups above size threshold. List<List<String>> winners = new ArrayList<List<String>>(); for (List<String> l : m.values()) if (l.size() >= minGroupSize) winners.add(l); // Sort anagram groups according to size Collections.sort(winners, new Comparator<List<String>>() { public int compare(List<String> o1, List<String> o2) { return o2.size() - o1.size(); }}); // Print anagram groups. for (List<String> l : winners) System.out.println(l.size() + \": \" + l); Running the program on the same dictionary as in The Map Interface section, with the same minimum anagram group size (eight), produces the following output. 12: [apers, apres, asper, pares, parse, pears, prase, presa, rapes, reaps, spare, spear] 11: [alerts, alters, artels, estral, laster, ratels, salter, slater, staler, stelar, talers] 10: [least, setal, slate, stale, steal, stela, taels, tales, teals, tesla] 9: [estrin, inerts, insert, inters, niters, nitres, sinter, triens, trines] 9: [capers, crapes, escarp, pacers, parsec, recaps, scrape, secpar, spacer] 9: [palest, palets, pastel, petals, plates, pleats, septal, staple, tepals] 9: [anestri, antsier, nastier, ratines, retains, retinas, retsina, stainer, stearin] 8: [lapse, leaps, pales, peals, pleas, salep, sepal, spale] 8: [aspers, parses, passer, prases, repass, spares, sparse, spears] 8: [enters, nester, renest, rentes, resent, tenser, ternes,treens] 8: [arles, earls, lares, laser, lears, rales, reals, seral] 8: [earings, erasing, gainers, reagins, regains, reginas, searing, seringa] 8: [peris, piers, pries, prise, ripes, speir, spier, spire] 8: [ates, east, eats, etas, sate, seat, seta, teas] 8: [carets, cartes, caster, caters, crates, reacts, recast,traces]\n",
      "Shuffling The Collections.shuffle algorithm does the opposite of what Collections.sort does, destroying any trace of order that may have been present in a List . That is, this algorithm reorders the List based on input from a source of randomness such that all possible permutations occur with equal likelihood, assuming a fair source of randomness. This algorithm is useful in implementing games of chance. For example, it could be used to shuffle a List of Card objects representing a deck. Also, it's useful for generating test cases. This operation has two forms: one takes a List and uses a default source of randomness, and the other requires the caller to provide a Random object to use as a source of randomness. The code for this algorithm is used as an example in the List section.\n",
      "Routine Data Manipulation The Collections class provides five algorithms for doing routine data manipulation on List objects, all of which are pretty straightforward: Collections.reverse ? reverses the order of the elements in a List . Collections.fill ? overwrites every element in a List with the specified value. This operation is useful for reinitializing a List . Collections.copy ? takes two arguments, a destination List and a source List , and copies the elements of the source into the destination, overwriting its contents. The destination List must be at least as long as the source. If it is longer, the remaining elements in the destination List are unaffected. Collections.swap ? swaps the elements at the specified positions in a List . Collections.addAll ? adds all the specified elements to a Collection . The elements to be added may be specified individually or as an array.\n",
      "Searching The Collections.binarySearch algorithm searches for a specified element in a sorted List . This algorithm has two forms. The first takes a List and an element to search for (the \"search key\"). This form assumes that the List is sorted in ascending order according to the natural ordering of its elements. The second form takes a Comparator in addition to the List and the search key, and assumes that the List is sorted into ascending order according to the specified Comparator . The Collections.sort algorithm can be used to sort the List prior to calling Collections.binarySearch .\n",
      "Searching - part 2 The return value is the same for both forms. If the List contains the search key, its index is returned. If not, the return value is (-(insertion point) - 1), where the insertion point is the point at which the value would be inserted into the List , or the index of the first element greater than the value or List.size() if all elements in the List are less than the specified value. This admittedly ugly formula guarantees that the return value will be >= 0 if and only if the search key is found. It's basically a hack to combine a boolean (found) and an integer (index) into a single int return value. The following idiom, usable with both forms of the Collections.binarySearch operation, looks for the specified search key and inserts it at the appropriate position if it's not already present. int pos = Collections.binarySearch(list, key); if (pos < 0) l.add(-pos-1);\n",
      "Composition The frequency and disjoint algorithms test some aspect of the composition of one or more Collections : Collections.frequency ? counts the number of times the specified element occurs in the specified collection Collections.disjoint ? determines whether two Collections are disjoint; that is, whether they contain no elements in common\n",
      "Finding Extreme Values The Collections.min and the Collections.max algorithms return, respectively, the minimum and maximum element contained in a specified Collection . Both of these operations come in two forms. The simple form takes only a Collection and returns the minimum (or maximum) element according to the elements' natural ordering. The second form takes a Comparator in addition to the Collection and returns the minimum (or maximum) element according to the specified Comparator .\n",
      "Lesson: Custom Collection Implementations Many programmers will never need to implement their own Collection s classes. You can go pretty far using the implementations described in the preceding sections of this chapter. However, someday you might want to write your own implementation. It is fairly easy to do this with the aid of the abstract implementations provided by the Java platform. Before we discuss how to write an implementation, let's discuss why you might want to write one.\n",
      "Reasons to Write an Implementation The following list illustrates the sort of custom Collection s you might want to implement. It is not intended to be exhaustive: Persistent: All of the built-in Collection implementations reside in main memory and vanish when the program exits. If you want a collection that will still be present the next time the program starts, you can implement it by building a veneer over an external database. Such a collection might be concurrently accessible by multiple programs. Application-specific: This is a very broad category. One example is an unmodifiable Map containing real-time telemetry data. The keys could represent locations, and the values could be read from sensors at these locations in response to the get operation. High-performance, special-purpose: Many data structures take advantage of restricted usage to offer better performance than is possible with general-purpose implementations. For instance, consider a List containing long runs of identical element values. Such lists, which occur frequently in text processing, can be run-length encoded ? runs can be represented as a single object containing the repeated element and the number of consecutive repetitions. This example is interesting because it trades off two aspects of performance: It requires less space but more time than an ArrayList . High-performance, general-purpose: The Java Collections Framework's designers tried to provide the best general-purpose implementations for each interface, but many, many data structures could have been used, and new ones are invented every day. Maybe you can come up with something faster! Enhanced functionality: Suppose you need an efficient bag implementation (also known as a multiset): a Collection that offers constant-time containment checks while allowing duplicate elements. It's reasonably straightforward to implement such a collection atop a HashMap . Convenience: You may want additional implementations that offer conveniences beyond those offered by the Java platform. For instance, you may frequently need List instances representing a contiguous range of Integer s. Adapter: Suppose you are using a legacy API that has its own ad hoc collections' API. You can write an adapter implementation that permits these collections to operate in the Java Collections Framework. An adapter implementation is a thin veneer that wraps objects of one type and makes them behave like objects of another type by translating operations on the latter type into operations on the former.\n",
      "How to Write a Custom Implementation Writing a custom implementation is surprisingly easy. The Java Collections Framework provides abstract implementations designed expressly to facilitate custom implementations. We'll start with the following example of an implementation of Arrays.asList . public static <T> List<T> asList(T[] a) { return new MyArrayList<T>(a); } private static class MyArrayList<T> extends AbstractList<T> { private final T[] a; MyArrayList(T[] array) { a = array; } public T get(int index) { return a[index]; } public T set(int index, T element) { T oldValue = a[index]; a[index] = element; return oldValue; } public int size() { return a.length; } } Believe it or not, this is very close to the implementation that is contained in java.util.Arrays . It's that simple! You provide a constructor and the AbstractList.get , AbstractList.set , and AbstractCollection.size methods, and AbstractList does all the rest. You get the ListIterator , bulk operations, search operations, hash code computation, comparison, and string representation for free. Suppose you want to make the implementation a bit faster. The API documentation for abstract implementations describes precisely how each method is implemented, so you'll know which methods to override to get the performance you want. The preceding implementation's performance is fine, but it can be improved a bit. In particular, the AbstractCollection.toArray method iterates over the List, copying one element at a time. Given the internal representation, it's a lot faster and more sensible just to clone the array. public Object[] toArray() { return (Object[]) a.clone(); }\n",
      "How to Write a Custom Implementation - part 2 With the addition of this override and a few more like it, this implementation is exactly the one found in java.util.Arrays . In the interest of full disclosure, it's a bit tougher to use the other abstract implementations because you will have to write your own iterator, but it's still not that difficult. The following list summarizes the abstract implementations: AbstractCollection ? a Collection that is neither a Set nor a List. At a minimum, you must provide the AbstractList.iterator and the AbstractCollection.size methods. AbstractSet ? a Set ; use is identical to AbstractCollection . AbstractList ? a List backed up by a random-access data store, such as an array. At a minimum, you must provide the positional access methods ( AbstractList.get and, optionally, AbstractList.set , AbstractList.remove , and AbstractList.add ) and the AbstractCollection.size method. The abstract class takes care of AbstractList.listIterator (and AbstractList.iterator ). AbstractSequentialList ? a List backed up by a sequential-access data store, such as a linked list. At a minimum, you must provide the AbstractList.listIterator and AbstractCollection.size methods. The abstract class takes care of the positional access methods. (This is the opposite of AbstractList .) AbstractQueue ? at a minimum, you must provide the offer, peek, poll, and AbstractCollection.size methods and an AbstractList.iterator supporting AbstractList.remove . AbstractMap ? a Map . At a minimum you must provide the entrySet view. This is typically implemented with the AbstractSet class. If the Map is modifiable, you must also provide the put method.\n",
      "List View of an Array The Arrays.asList method returns a List view of its array argument. Changes to the List write through to the array and vice versa. The size of the collection is that of the array and cannot be changed. If the add or the remove method is called on the List, an UnsupportedOperationException will result. The normal use of this implementation is as a bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs. It allows you to pass an array to a method expecting a Collection or a List. However, this implementation also has another use. If you need a fixed-size List, it's more efficient than any general-purpose List implementation. This is the idiom. List<String> list = Arrays.asList(new String[size]); Note that a reference to the backing array is not retained.\n",
      "Immutable Multiple-Copy List Occasionally you'll need an immutable List consisting of multiple copies of the same element. The Collections.nCopies method returns such a list. This implementation has two main uses. The first is to initialize a newly created List; for example, suppose you want an ArrayList initially consisting of 1,000 null elements. The following incantation does the trick. List<Type> list = new ArrayList<Type>(Collections.nCopies(1000, (Type)null); Of course, the initial value of each element need not be null. The second main use is to grow an existing List. For example, suppose you want to add 69 copies of the string \"fruit bat\" to the end of a List<String>. It's not clear why you'd want to do such a thing, but let's just suppose you did. The following is how you'd do it. lovablePets.addAll(Collections.nCopies(69, \"fruit bat\")); By using the form of addAll that takes both an index and a Collection , you can add the new elements to the middle of a List instead of to the end of it.\n",
      "Immutable Singleton Set Sometimes you'll need an immutable singleton Set , which consists of a single, specified element. The Collections.singleton method returns such a Set . One use of this implementation is to remove all occurrences of a specified element from a Collection . c.removeAll(Collections.singleton(e)); A related idiom removes all elements that map to a specified value from a Map . For example, suppose you have a Map ? job ? that maps people to their line of work and suppose you want to eliminate all the lawyers. The following one-liner will do the deed. job.values().removeAll(Collections.singleton(LAWYER)); One more use of this implementation is to provide a single input value to a method that is written to accept a collection of values.\n",
      "Empty Set List and Map Constants The Collections class provides methods to return the empty Set , List, and Map ? Collections.emptySet , Collections.emptyList , and Collections.emptyMap . The main use of these constants is as input to methods that take a Collection of values when you don't want to provide any values at all, as in this example. tourist.declarePurchases(Collections.emptySet());\n",
      "Deque Implementations The Deque interface, pronounced as \"deck\", represents a double-ended queue. The Deque interface can be implemented as various types of Collections . The Deque interface implementations are grouped into general-purpose and concurrent implementations.\n",
      "General-Purpose Deque Implementations The general-purpose implementations include LinkedList and ArrayDeque classes. The Deque interface supports insertion, removal and retrieval of elements at both ends. The ArrayDeque class is the resizable array implementation of the Deque interface, whereas the LinkedList class is the list implementation. The basic insertion, removal and retieval operations in the Deque interface addFirst, addLast, removeFirst, removeLast, getFirst and getLast. The method addFirst adds an element at the head whereas addLast adds an element at the tail of the Deque instance. The LinkedList implementation is more flexible than the ArrayDeque implementation. LinkedList implements all optional list operations. null elements are allowed in the LinkedList implementation but not in the ArrayDeque implementation. In terms of efficiency, ArrayDeque is more efficient than the LinkedList for add and remove operation at both ends. The best operation in a LinkedList implementation is removing the current element during the iteration. LinkedList implementations are not ideal structures to iterate. The LinkedList implementation consumes more memory than the ArrayDeque implementation. For the ArrayDeque instance traversal use any of the following:\n",
      "Concurrent Deque Implementations The LinkedBlockingDeque class is the concurrent implementation of the Deque interface. If the deque is empty then methods such as LinkedBlockingDeque.takeFirst and LinkedBlockingDeque.takeLast wait until the element becomes available, and then retrieves and removes the same element.\n",
      "Lesson: Implementations - part 2 The general-purpose implementations are summarized in the following table. General-purpose Implementations Interfaces Hash table Implementations Resizable array Implementations Tree Implementations Linked list Implementations Hash table + Linked list Implementations Set HashSet TreeSet LinkedHashSet List ArrayList LinkedList Queue Deque ArrayDeque LinkedList Map HashMap TreeMap LinkedHashMap As you can see from the table, the Java Collections Framework provides several general-purpose implementations of the Set , List , and Map interfaces. In each case, one implementation ? HashSet , ArrayList , and HashMap ? is clearly the one to use for most applications, all other things being equal. Note that the SortedSet and the SortedMap interfaces do not have rows in the table. Each of those interfaces has one implementation ( TreeSet and TreeMap ) and is listed in the Set and the Map rows. There are two general-purpose Queue implementations ? LinkedList , which is also a List implementation, and PriorityQueue , which is omitted from the table. These two implementations provide very different semantics: LinkedList provides FIFO semantics, while PriorityQueue orders its elements according to their values.\n",
      "Lesson: Implementations - part 3 Each of the general-purpose implementations provides all optional operations contained in its interface. All permit null elements, keys, and values. None are synchronized (thread-safe). All have fail-fast iterators, which detect illegal concurrent modification during iteration and fail quickly and cleanly rather than risking arbitrary, nondeterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. All are Serializable and all support a public clone method. The fact that these implementations are unsynchronized represents a break with the past: The legacy collections Vector and Hashtable are synchronized. The present approach was taken because collections are frequently used when the synchronization is of no benefit. Such uses include single-threaded use, read-only use, and use as part of a larger data object that does its own synchronization. In general, it is good API design practice not to make users pay for a feature they don't use. Furthermore, unnecessary synchronization can result in deadlock under certain circumstances.\n",
      "Lesson: Implementations - part 4 If you need thread-safe collections, the synchronization wrappers, described in the Wrapper Implementations section, allow any collection to be transformed into a synchronized collection. Thus, synchronization is optional for general-purpose implementations, whereas it is mandatory for legacy implementations. Moreover, the java.util.concurrent package provides concurrent implementations of the BlockingQueue interface, which extends Queue, and of the ConcurrentMap interface, which extends Map . These implementations offer much higher concurrency than mere synchronized implementations. As a rule, you should be thinking about the interfaces, BigInteger.not the implementations. That is why there are no programming examples in this section. For the most part, the choice of implementation affects only performance. The preferred style, as mentioned in the Interfaces section, is to choose an implementation when a Collection is created and to immediately assign the new collection to a variable of the corresponding interface type (or to pass the collection to a method expecting an argument of the interface type). In this way, the program does not become dependent on any added methods in a given implementation, leaving the programmer free to change implementations anytime that it is warranted by performance concerns or behavioral details.\n",
      "General-Purpose List Implementations There are two general-purpose List implementations ? ArrayList and LinkedList . Most of the time, you'll probably use ArrayList , which offers constant-time positional access and is just plain fast. It does not have to allocate a node object for each element in the List, and it can take advantage of System.arraycopy when it has to move multiple elements at the same time. Think of ArrayList as Vector without the synchronization overhead. If you frequently add elements to the beginning of the List or iterate over the List to delete elements from its interior, you should consider using LinkedList . These operations require constant-time in a LinkedList and linear-time in an ArrayList . But you pay a big price in performance. Positional access requires linear-time in a LinkedList and constant-time in an ArrayList . Furthermore, the constant factor for LinkedList is much worse. If you think you want to use a LinkedList , measure the performance of your application with both LinkedList and ArrayList before making your choice; ArrayList is usually faster.\n",
      "General-Purpose List Implementations - part 2 ArrayList has one tuning parameter ? the initial capacity, which refers to the number of elements the ArrayList can hold before it has to grow. LinkedList has no tuning parameters and seven optional operations, one of which is clone. The other six are LinkedList.addFirst , LinkedList.getFirst , LinkedList.removeFirst , LinkedList.addLast , LinkedList.getLast , and LinkedList.removeLast . LinkedList also implements the Queue interface.\n",
      "Special-Purpose List Implementations CopyOnWriteArrayList is a List implementation backed up by a copy-on-write array. This implementation is similar in nature to CopyOnWriteArraySet . No synchronization is necessary, even during iteration, and iterators are guaranteed never to throw ConcurrentModificationException . This implementation is well suited to maintaining event-handler lists, in which change is infrequent, and traversal is frequent and potentially time-consuming. If you need synchronization, a Vector will be slightly faster than an ArrayList synchronized with Collections.synchronizedList . But Vector has loads of legacy operations, so be careful to always manipulate the Vector with the List interface or else you won't be able to replace the implementation at a later time. If your List is fixed in size ? that is, you'll never use remove, add, or any of the bulk operations other than containsAll ? you have a third option that's definitely worth considering. See Arrays.asList in the Convenience Implementations section for more information.\n",
      "Map Implementations Map implementations are grouped into general-purpose, special-purpose, and concurrent implementations.\n",
      "General-Purpose Map Implementations The three general-purpose Map implementations are HashMap , TreeMap and LinkedHashMap . If you need SortedMap operations or key-ordered Collection -view iteration, use TreeMap ; if you want maximum speed and don't care about iteration order, use HashMap ; if you want near- HashMap performance and insertion-order iteration, use LinkedHashMap . In this respect, the situation for Map is analogous to Set . Likewise, everything else in the Set Implementations section also applies to Map implementations. LinkedHashMap provides two capabilities that are not available with LinkedHashSet . When you create a LinkedHashMap , you can order it based on key access rather than insertion. In other words, merely looking up the value associated with a key brings that key to the end of the map. Also, LinkedHashMap provides the LinkedHashMap.removeEldestEntry method, which may be overridden to impose a policy for removing stale mappings automatically when new mappings are added to the map. This makes it very easy to implement a custom cache.\n",
      "Special-Purpose Map Implementations There are three special-purpose Map implementations ? EnumMap , WeakHashMap and IdentityHashMap . EnumMap , which is internally implemented as an array, is a high-performance Map implementation for use with enum keys. This implementation combines the richness and safety of the Map interface with a speed approaching that of an array. If you want to map an enum to a value, you should always use an EnumMap in preference to an array. WeakHashMap is an implementation of the Map interface that stores only weak references to its keys. Storing only weak references allows a key-value pair to be garbage-collected when its key is no longer referenced outside of the WeakHashMap . This class provides the easiest way to harness the power of weak references. It is useful for implementing \"registry-like\" data structures, where the utility of an entry vanishes when its key is no longer reachable by any thread.\n",
      "Special-Purpose Map Implementations - part 2 IdentityHashMap is an identity-based Map implementation based on a hash table. This class is useful for topology-preserving object graph transformations, such as serialization or deep-copying. To perform such transformations, you need to maintain an identity-based \"node table\" that keeps track of which objects have already been seen. Identity-based maps are also used to maintain object-to-meta-information mappings in dynamic debuggers and similar systems. Finally, identity-based maps are useful in thwarting \"spoof attacks\" that are a result of intentionally perverse equals methods because IdentityHashMap never invokes the equals method on its keys. An added benefit of this implementation is that it is fast.\n",
      "Concurrent Map Implementations The java.util.concurrent package contains the ConcurrentMap interface, which extends Map with atomic putIfAbsent, remove, and replace methods, and the ConcurrentHashMap implementation of that interface. ConcurrentHashMap is a highly concurrent, high-performance implementation backed up by a hash table. This implementation never blocks when performing retrievals and allows the client to select the concurrency level for updates. It is intended as a drop-in replacement for Hashtable : in addition to implementing ConcurrentMap , it supports all the legacy methods peculiar to Hashtable . Again, if you don't need the legacy operations, be careful to manipulate it with the ConcurrentMap interface.\n",
      "Questions Question: You plan to write a program that uses several basic collection interfaces: Set , List, Queue, and Map . You're not sure which implementations will work best, so you decide to use general-purpose implementations until you get a better idea how your program will work in the real world. Which implementations are these? Answer: Set : HashSet List: ArrayList Queue: LinkedList Map : HashMap Question: If you need a Set implementation that provides value-ordered iteration, which class should you use? Answer: TreeSet guarantees that the sorted set is in ascending element order, sorted according to the natural order of the elements or by the Comparator provided. Question: Which class do you use to access wrapper implementations? Answer: You use the Collections class, which provides static methods that operate on or return collections.\n",
      "Exercises Exercise: Write a program that reads a text file, specified by the first command line argument, into a List. The program should then print random lines from the file, the number of lines printed to be specified by the second command line argument. Write the program so that a correctly-sized collection is allocated all at once, instead of being gradually expanded as the file is read in. Hint: To determine the number of lines in the file, use java.io.File.length to obtain the size of the file, then divide by an assumed size of an average line. Answer: Since we are accessing the List randomly, we will use ArrayList . We estimate the number of lines by taking the file size and dividing by 50. We then double that figure, since it is more efficient to overestimate than to underestmate. import java.util.*; import java.io.*; public class FileList { public static void main(String[] args) { final int assumedLineLength = 50; File file = new File(args[0]); List<String> fileList = new ArrayList<String>((int)(file.length() / assumedLineLength) * 2); BufferedReader reader = null; int lineCount = 0; try { reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); for (String line = reader.readLine(); line != null; line = reader.readLine()) { fileList.add(line); lineCount++; } } catch (IOException e) { System.err.format(\"Could not read %s: %s%n\", file, e); System.exit(1); } finally { if (reader != null) { try { reader.close(); } catch (IOException e) {} } } int repeats = Integer.parseInt(args[1]); Random random = new Random(); for (int i = 0; i < repeats; i++) { System.out.format(\"%d: %s%n\", i, fileList.get(random.nextInt(lineCount - 1))); } } } This program actually spends most of its time reading in the file, so pre-allocating the ArrayList has little affect on its performance. Specifying an initial capacity in advance is more likely to be useful when your program repeatly creates large ArrayList objects without intervening I/O.\n",
      "General-Purpose Queue Implementations As mentioned in the previous section, LinkedList implements the Queue interface, providing first in, first out (FIFO) queue operations for add, poll, and so on. The PriorityQueue class is a priority queue based on the heap data structure. This queue orders elements according to the order specified at construction time, which can be the elements' natural ordering or the ordering imposed by an explicit Comparator . The queue retrieval operations ? poll, remove, peek , and element ? access the element at the head of the queue. The Queue.head of the queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering. If multiple elements are tied for least value, the head is one of those elements; ties are broken arbitrarily. PriorityQueue and its iterator implement all of the optional methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces. The iterator provided in method iterator is not guaranteed to traverse the elements of the PriorityQueue in any particular order. For ordered traversal, consider using Arrays.sort(pq.toArray()) .\n",
      "Concurrent Queue Implementations The java.util.concurrent package contains a set of synchronized Queue interfaces and classes. BlockingQueue extends Queue with operations that wait for the queue to become nonempty when retrieving an element and for space to become available in the queue when storing an element. This interface is implemented by the following classes: LinkedBlockingQueue ? an optionally bounded FIFO blocking queue backed by linked nodes ArrayBlockingQueue ? a bounded FIFO blocking queue backed by an array PriorityBlockingQueue ? an unbounded blocking priority queue backed by a heap DelayQueue ? a time-based scheduling queue backed by a heap SynchronousQueue ? a simple rendezvous mechanism that uses the BlockingQueue interface In JDK 7, TransferQueue is a specialized BlockingQueue in which code that adds an element to the queue has the option of waiting (blocking) for code in another thread to retrieve the element. TransferQueue has a single implementation: LinkedTransferQueue ? an unbounded TransferQueue based on linked nodes\n",
      "Set Implementations The Set implementations are grouped into general-purpose and special-purpose implementations.\n",
      "General-Purpose Set Implementations There are three general-purpose Set implementations ? HashSet , TreeSet , and LinkedHashSet . Which of these three to use is generally straightforward. HashSet is much faster than TreeSet (constant-time versus log-time for most operations) but offers no ordering guarantees. If you need to use the operations in the SortedSet interface, or if value-ordered iteration is required, use TreeSet ; otherwise, use HashSet . It's a fair bet that you'll end up using HashSet most of the time. LinkedHashSet is in some sense intermediate between HashSet and TreeSet . Implemented as a hash table with a linked list running through it, it provides insertion-ordered iteration (least recently inserted to most recently) and runs nearly as fast as HashSet . The LinkedHashSet implementation spares its clients from the unspecified, generally chaotic ordering provided by HashSet without incurring the increased cost associated with TreeSet .\n",
      "General-Purpose Set Implementations - part 2 One thing worth keeping in mind about HashSet is that iteration is linear in the sum of the number of entries and the number of buckets (the capacity). Thus, choosing an initial capacity that's too high can waste both space and time. On the other hand, choosing an initial capacity that's too low wastes time by copying the data structure each time it's forced to increase its capacity. If you don't specify an initial capacity, the default is 16. In the past, there was some advantage to choosing a prime number as the initial capacity. This is no longer true. Internally, the capacity is always rounded up to a power of two. The initial capacity is specified by using the int constructor. The following line of code allocates a HashSet whose initial capacity is 64. Set<String> s = new HashSet<String>(64);\n",
      "General-Purpose Set Implementations - part 3 The HashSet class has one other tuning parameter called the load factor. If you care a lot about the space consumption of your HashSet , read the HashSet documentation for more information. Otherwise, just accept the default; it's almost always the right thing to do. If you accept the default load factor but want to specify an initial capacity, pick a number that's about twice the size to which you expect the set to grow. If your guess is way off, you may waste a bit of space, time, or both, but it's unlikely to be a big problem. LinkedHashSet has the same tuning parameters as HashSet , but iteration time is not affected by capacity. TreeSet has no tuning parameters.\n",
      "Special-Purpose Set Implementations There are two special-purpose Set implementations ? EnumSet and CopyOnWriteArraySet . EnumSet is a high-performance Set implementation for enum types. All of the members of an enum set must be of the same enum type. Internally, it is represented by a bit-vector, typically a single long. Enum sets support iteration over ranges of enum types. For example, given the enum declaration for the days of the week, you can iterate over the weekdays. The EnumSet class provides a static factory that makes it easy. for (Day d : EnumSet.range(Day.MONDAY, Day.FRIDAY)) System.out.println(d); Enum sets also provide a rich, typesafe replacement for traditional bit flags. EnumSet.of(Style.BOLD, Style.ITALIC) CopyOnWriteArraySet is a Set implementation backed up by a copy-on-write array. All mutative operations, such as add, set, and remove, are implemented by making a new copy of the array; no locking is ever required. Even iteration may safely proceed concurrently with element insertion and deletion. Unlike most Set implementations, the add, remove, and contains methods require time proportional to the size of the set. This implementation is only appropriate for sets that are rarely modified but frequently iterated. It is well suited to maintaining event-handler lists that must prevent duplicates.\n",
      "Summary of Implementations Implementations are the data objects used to store collections, which implement the interfaces described in the Interfaces lesson. The Java Collections Framework provides several general-purpose implementations of the core interfaces: For the Set interface, HashSet is the most commonly used implementation. For the List interface, ArrayList is the most commonly used implementation. For the Map interface, HashMap is the most commonly used implementation. For the Queue interface, LinkedList is the most commonly used implementation. For the Deque interface, ArrayDeque is the most commonly used implementation. Each of the general-purpose implementations provides all optional operations contained in its interface. The Java Collections Framework also provides several special-purpose implementations for situations that require nonstandard performance, usage restrictions, or other unusual behavior. The java.util.concurrent package contains several collections implementations, which are thread-safe but not governed by a single exclusion lock.\n",
      "Summary of Implementations - part 2 The Collections class (as opposed to the Collection interface), provides static methods that operate on or return collections, which are known as Wrapper implementations. Finally, there are several Convenience implementations, which can be more efficient than general-purpose implementations when you don't need their full power. The Convenience implementations are made available through static factory methods.\n",
      "Wrapper Implementations Wrapper implementations delegate all their real work to a specified collection but add extra functionality on top of what this collection offers. For design pattern fans, this is an example of the decorator pattern. Although it may seem a bit exotic, it's really pretty straightforward. These implementations are anonymous; rather than providing a public class, the library provides a static factory method. All these implementations are found in the Collections class, which consists solely of static methods.\n",
      "Synchronization Wrappers The synchronization wrappers add automatic synchronization (thread-safety) to an arbitrary collection. Each of the six core collection interfaces ? Collection , Set , List, Map , SortedSet , and SortedMap ? has one static factory method. public static <T> Collection<T> synchronizedCollection(Collection<T> c); public static <T> Set<T> synchronizedSet(Set<T> s); public static <T> List<T> synchronizedList(List<T> list); public static <K,V> Map<K,V> synchronizedMap(Map<K,V> m); public static <T> SortedSet<T> synchronizedSortedSet(SortedSet<T> s); public static <K,V> SortedMap<K,V> synchronizedSortedMap(SortedMap<K,V> m); Each of these methods returns a synchronized (thread-safe) Collection backed up by the specified collection. To guarantee serial access, all access to the backing collection must be accomplished through the returned collection. The easy way to guarantee this is not to keep a reference to the backing collection. Create the synchronized collection with the following trick. List<Type> list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<Type>()); A collection created in this fashion is every bit as thread-safe as a normally synchronized collection, such as a Vector . In the face of concurrent access, it is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned collection when iterating over it. The reason is that iteration is accomplished via multiple calls into the collection, which must be composed into a single atomic operation. The following is the idiom to iterate over a wrapper-synchronized collection. Collection<Type> c = Collections.synchronizedCollection(myCollection); synchronized(c) { for (Type e : c) foo(e); }\n",
      "Synchronization Wrappers - part 2 If an explicit iterator is used, the iterator method must be called from within the synchronized block. Failure to follow this advice may result in nondeterministic behavior. The idiom for iterating over a Collection view of a synchronized Map is similar. It is imperative that the user synchronize on the synchronized Map when iterating over any of its Collection views rather than synchronizing on the Collection view itself, as shown in the following example. Map<KeyType, ValType> m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<KeyType, ValType>()); ... Set<KeyType> s = m.keySet(); ... // Synchronizing on m, not s! synchronized(m) { while (KeyType k : s) foo(k); } One minor downside of using wrapper implementations is that you do not have the ability to execute any noninterface operations of a wrapped implementation. So, for instance, in the preceding List example, you cannot call ArrayList 's ensureCapacity operation on the wrapped ArrayList .\n",
      "Unmodifiable Wrappers Unlike synchronization wrappers, which add functionality to the wrapped collection, the unmodifiable wrappers take functionality away. In particular, they take away the ability to modify the collection by intercepting all the operations that would modify the collection and throwing an UnsupportedOperationException . Unmodifiable wrappers have two main uses, as follows: To make a collection immutable once it has been built. In this case, it's good practice not to maintain a reference to the backing collection. This absolutely guarantees immutability. To allow certain clients read-only access to your data structures. You keep a reference to the backing collection but hand out a reference to the wrapper. In this way, clients can look but not modify, while you maintain full access. Like synchronization wrappers, each of the six core Collection interfaces has one static factory method. public static <T> Collection<T> unmodifiableCollection(Collection<? extends T> c); public static <T> Set<T> unmodifiableSet(Set<? extends T> s); public static <T> List<T> unmodifiableList(List<? extends T> list); public static <K,V> Map<K, V> unmodifiableMap(Map<? extends K, ? extends V> m); public static <T> SortedSet<T> unmodifiableSortedSet(SortedSet<? extends T> s); public static <K,V> SortedMap<K, V> unmodifiableSortedMap(SortedMap<K, ? extends V> m);\n",
      "Checked Interface Wrappers The Collections.checked interface wrappers are provided for use with generic collections. These implementations return a dynamically type-safe view of the specified collection, which throws a ClassCastException if a client attempts to add an element of the wrong type. The generics mechanism in the language provides compile-time (static) type-checking, but it is possible to defeat this mechanism. Dynamically type-safe views eliminate this possibility entirely.\n",
      "Parameters If your API contains a method that requires a collection on input, it is of paramount importance that you declare the relevant parameter type to be one of the collection interface types. Never use an implementation type because this defeats the purpose of an interface-based Collections Framework, which is to allow collections to be manipulated without regard to implementation details. Further, you should always use the least-specific type that makes sense. For example, don't require a List or a Set if a Collection would do. It's not that you should never require a List or a Set on input; it is correct to do so if a method depends on a property of one of these interfaces. For example, many of the algorithms provided by the Java platform require a List on input because they depend on the fact that lists are ordered. As a general rule, however, the best types to use on input are the most general: Collection and Map . Caution: Never define your own ad hoc collection class and require objects of this class on input. By doing this, you'd lose all the benefits provided by the Java Collections Framework.\n",
      "Return Values You can afford to be much more flexible with return values than with input parameters. It's fine to return an object of any type that implements or extends one of the collection interfaces. This can be one of the interfaces or a special-purpose type that extends or implements one of these interfaces. For example, one could imagine an image-processing package, called ImageList, that returned objects of a new class that implements List. In addition to the List operations, ImageList could support any application-specific operations that seemed desirable. For example, it might provide an indexImage operation that returned an image containing thumbnail images of each graphic in the ImageList. It's critical to note that even if the API furnishes ImageList instances on output, it should accept arbitrary Collection (or perhaps List) instances on input.\n",
      "Return Values - part 2 In one sense, return values should have the opposite behavior of input parameters: It's best to return the most specific applicable collection interface rather than the most general. For example, if you're sure that you'll always return a SortedMap , you should give the relevant method the return type of SortedMap rather than Map . SortedMap instances are more time-consuming to build than ordinary Map instances and are also more powerful. Given that your module has already invested the time to build a SortedMap , it makes good sense to give the user access to its increased power. Furthermore, the user will be able to pass the returned object to methods that demand a SortedMap , as well as those that accept any Map .\n",
      "Compatibility The Java Collections Framework was designed to ensure complete interoperability between the core collection interfaces and the types that were used to represent collections in the early versions of the Java platform: Vector , Hashtable , array, and Enumeration . In this section, you'll learn how to transform old collections to the Java Collections Framework collections and vice versa.\n",
      "Upward Compatibility Suppose that you're using an API that returns legacy collections in tandem with another API that requires objects implementing the collection interfaces. To make the two APIs interoperate smoothly, you'll have to transform the legacy collections into modern collections. Luckily, the Java Collections Framework makes this easy. Suppose the old API returns an array of objects and the new API requires a Collection . The Collections Framework has a convenience implementation that allows an array of objects to be viewed as a List. You use Arrays.asList to pass an array to any method requiring a Collection or a List. Foo[] result = oldMethod(arg); newMethod(Arrays.asList(result)); If the old API returns a Vector or a Hashtable , you have no work to do at all because Vector was retrofitted to implement the List interface, and Hashtable was retrofitted to implement Map . Therefore, a Vector may be passed directly to any method calling for a Collection or a List. Vector result = oldMethod(arg); newMethod(result); Similarly, a Hashtable may be passed directly to any method calling for a Map . Hashtable result = oldMethod(arg); newMethod(result); Less frequently, an API may return an Enumeration that represents a collection of objects. The Collections.list method translates an Enumeration into a Collection . Enumeration e = oldMethod(arg); newMethod(Collections.list(e));\n",
      "Backward Compatibility Suppose you're using an API that returns modern collections in tandem with another API that requires you to pass in legacy collections. To make the two APIs interoperate smoothly, you have to transform modern collections into old collections. Again, the Java Collections Framework makes this easy. Suppose the new API returns a Collection , and the old API requires an array of Object . As you're probably aware, the Collection interface contains a Collection.toArray method designed expressly for this situation. Collection c = newMethod(); oldMethod(c.toArray()); What if the old API requires an array of String (or another type) instead of an array of Object ? You just use the other form of Collection.toArray ? the one that takes an array on input. Collection c = newMethod(); oldMethod((String[]) c.toArray(new String[0])); If the old API requires a Vector , the standard collection constructor comes in handy. Collection c = newMethod(); oldMethod(new Vector(c)); The case where the old API requires a Hashtable is handled analogously. Map m = newMethod(); oldMethod(new Hashtable(m));\n",
      "Backward Compatibility - part 2 Finally, what do you do if the old API requires an Enumeration ? This case isn't common, but it does happen from time to time, and the Collections.enumeration method was provided to handle it. This is a static factory method that takes a Collection and returns an Enumeration over the elements of the Collection . Collection c = newMethod(); oldMethod(Collections.enumeration(c));\n",
      "What Is a Collections Framework? A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following: Interfaces: These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy. Implementations: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures. Algorithms: These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface. In essence, algorithms are reusable functionality. Apart from the Java Collections Framework, the best-known examples of collections frameworks are the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and Smalltalk's collection hierarchy. Historically, collections frameworks have been quite complex, which gave them a reputation for having a steep learning curve. We believe that the Java Collections Framework breaks with this tradition, as you will learn for yourself in this chapter.\n",
      "Benefits of the Java Collections Framework The Java Collections Framework provides the following benefits: Reduces programming effort: By providing useful data structures and algorithms, the Collections Framework frees you to concentrate on the important parts of your program rather than on the low-level \"plumbing\" required to make it work. By facilitating interoperability among unrelated APIs, the Java Collections Framework frees you from writing adapter objects or conversion code to connect APIs. Increases program speed and quality: This Collections Framework provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms. The various implementations of each interface are interchangeable, so programs can be easily tuned by switching collection implementations. Because you're freed from the drudgery of writing your own data structures, you'll have more time to devote to improving programs' quality and performance. Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs: The collection interfaces are the vernacular by which APIs pass collections back and forth. If my network administration API furnishes a collection of node names and if your GUI toolkit expects a collection of column headings, our APIs will interoperate seamlessly, even though they were written independently. Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs: Many APIs naturally take collections on input and furnish them as output. In the past, each such API had a small sub-API devoted to manipulating its collections. There was little consistency among these ad hoc collections sub-APIs, so you had to learn each one from scratch, and it was easy to make mistakes when using them. With the advent of standard collection interfaces, the problem went away. Reduces effort to design new APIs: This is the flip side of the previous advantage. Designers and implementers don't have to reinvent the wheel each time they create an API that relies on collections; instead, they can use standard collection interfaces. Fosters software reuse: New data structures that conform to the standard collection interfaces are by nature reusable. The same goes for new algorithms that operate on objects that implement these interfaces.\n",
      "READING FILE: E:/UTD/Research/fragmentation/McGill\\tutorial_jcol.csv\n",
      "Java's Stack Class The java.util.Stack class deserves a little explanation on its own. In the text on the List interface the Stack class is listed as an implementation. The typical use of a Stack is not as a List though. A Stack is a data structure where you add elements to the \"top\" of the stack, and also remove elements from the top again. This is also referred to as the \"Last In First Out (LIFO)\" principle. In contrast, a Queue uses a \"First In First Out (FIFO)\" principle. Stack 's are really handy for some types of data processing, for instance if you are parsing an XML file using either SAX or StAX. For an example, see my Java SAX Example in my Java XML tutorial. Here is a Stack usage example: Stack stack = new Stack(); stack.push(\"1\"); stack.push(\"2\"); stack.push(\"3\"); //look at top object (\"3\"), without taking it off the stack. Object objTop = stack.peek(); Object obj3 = stack.pop(); //the string \"3\" is at the top of the stack. Object obj2 = stack.pop(); //the string \"2\" is at the top of the stack. Object obj1 = stack.pop(); //the string \"1\" is at the top of the stack. The Stack.push() method pushes an object onto the top of the Stack . The Stack.peek() method returns the object at the top of the Stack , but leaves the object on of the Stack . The Stack.pop() method returns the object at the top of the stack, and removes the object from the Stack .\n",
      "Searching the Stack You can search for an object on the stack to get it's index, using the Stack.search() method. The object's equals() method is called on every object on the Stack to determine if the searched-for object is present on the Stack . The index you get is the index from the top of the Stack , meaning the top element on the Stack has index 1. Here is how you search a Stack for an object: Stack stack = new Stack(); stack.push(\"1\"); stack.push(\"2\"); stack.push(\"3\"); int index = stack.search(\"3\"); //index = 3\n",
      "Java's NavigableMap Interface The java.util.NavigableMap interface is a subtype of the java.util.SortedMap interface. It has a few extensions to the SortedSet which makes it possible to navigate the map. I will take a closer look at these navigation methods in this text. The java.util package only has one implementation of the NavigableMap interface: java.util.TreeMap . There is an implementation in the java.util.concurrent package but that is outside the scope of this trail. Here is a list of the topics covered in this text: descendingKeySet() and descendingMap() headMap(), tailMap() and subMap() ceilingKey(), floorKey(), higherKey() and lowerKey() ceilingEntry(), floorEntry(), higherEntry() and lowerEntry() pollFirstEntry() and pollLastEntry() More detail in the JavaDoc\n",
      "descendingKeySet() and descendingMap() The first interesting navigation methods are the NavigableMap.descendingKeySet() and NavigableMap.descendingMap() methods. The NavigableMap.descendingKeySet() method returns a NavigableSet in which the order of the elements is reversed compared to the original key set. The returned \"view\" is backed by the original NavigableSet ket set, so changes to the descending set are also reflected in the original set. However, you should not remove elements directly from the key set. Use the Map.Map.remove() method instead. Here is a simple example: NavigableSet reverse = map.descendingKeySet(); The NavigableMap.descendingMap() method returns a NavigableMap which is a view of the original Map . The order of the elements in this view map is reverse of the order of the original map. Being a view of the original map, any changes to this view is also reflected in the original map. Here is a simple example: NavigableMap descending = map.descendingMap();\n",
      "headMap(), tailMap() and subMap() The NavigableMap.headMap() method returns a view of the original NavigableMap which only contains elements that are \"less than\" the given element. Here is an example: NavigableMap original = new TreeMap(); original.put(\"1\", \"1\"); original.put(\"2\", \"2\"); original.put(\"3\", \"3\"); //this headmap1 will contain \"1\" and \"2\" SortedMap headmap1 = original.headMap(\"3\"); //this headmap2 will contain \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\" because \"inclusive\"=true NavigableMap headmap2 = original.headMap(\"3\", true); The NavigableMap.tailMap() method works the same way, except it returns all elements that are higher than the given parameter element. The NavigableMap.subMap() allows you to pass two parameters demarcating the boundaries of the view map to return. Here is an example: NavigableMap original = new TreeMap(); original.put(\"1\", \"1\"); original.add(\"2\", \"2\"); original.add(\"3\", \"3\"); original.add(\"4\", \"4\"); original.add(\"5\", \"5\"); //this submap1 will contain \"3\", \"3\" SortedMap submap1 = original.subMap(\"2\", \"4\"); //this submap2 will contain (\"2\", \"2\") (\"3\", \"3\") and (\"4\", \"4\") because // fromInclusive=true, and toInclusive=true NavigableMap submap2 = original.subMap(\"2\", true, \"4\", true);\n",
      "ceilingKey(), floorKey(), higherKey() and lowerKey() The NavigableMap.ceilingKey() method returns the least (smallest) key in this map that is greater than or equal to the element passed as parameter to the NavigableMap.ceilingKey() method. Here is an example: NavigableMap original = new TreeMap(); original.put(\"1\", \"1\"); original.put(\"2\", \"2\"); original.put(\"3\", \"3\"); //ceilingKey will be \"2\". Object ceilingKey = original.ceilingKey(\"2\"); //floorKey will be \"2\". Object floorKey = original.floorKey(\"2\"); The NavigableMap.floorKey() method does the opposite of NavigableMap.ceilingKey() The NavigableMap.higherKey() method returns the least (smallest) element in this map that is greater than (not equal too) the element passed as parameter to the NavigableMap.higherKey() method. Here is an example: NavigableMap original = new TreeMap(); original.put(\"1\", \"1\"); original.put(\"2\", \"2\"); original.put(\"3\", \"3\"); //higherKey will be \"3\". Object higherKey = original.higherKey(\"2\"); //lowerKey will be \"1\" Object lowerKey = original.lowerKey(\"2\"); The NavigableMap.lowerKey() method does the opposite of the NavigableMap.higherKey() method.\n",
      "celingEntry(), floorEntry(), higherEntry(), lowerEntry() The NavigableMap also has methods to get the entry for a given key, rather than the key itself. These methods behave like the NavigableMap.ceilingKey() etc. methods, except they return an Map.Entry instead of the key object itself. A Map.Entry maps a single key to a single value. Here is a simple example. For more details, check out the JavaDoc. NavigableMap original = new TreeMap(); original.put(\"1\", \"1\"); original.put(\"2\", \"2\"); original.put(\"3\", \"3\"); //higherEntry will be (\"3\", \"3\"). Map.Entry higherEntry = original.higherEntry(\"2\"); //lowerEntry will be (\"1\", \"1\") Map.Entry lowerEntry = original.lowerEntry(\"2\");\n",
      "pollFirstEntry() and pollLastEntry() The NavigableMap.pollFirstEntry() method returns and removes the \"first\" entry (key + value) in the NavigableMap or null if the map is empty. The NavigableMap.pollLastEntry() returns and removes the \"last\" element in the map or null if the map is empty. \"First\" means smallest element according to the sort order of the keys. \"Last\" means largest key according to the element sorting order of the map. Here are two examples: NavigableMap original = new TreeMap(); original.put(\"1\", \"1\"); original.put(\"2\", \"2\"); original.put(\"3\", \"3\"); //first is (\"1\", \"1\") Map.Entry first = original.pollFirstEntry(); //last is (\"3\", \"3\") Map.Entry last = original.pollLastEntry();\n",
      "More Detail in the JavaDoc There are still a few interesting methods left in the NavigableMap interface that I have not covered here. For instance, the NavigableMap.firstEntry() and NavigableMap.lastEntry() methods. You can check out these last methods in the official JavaDoc.\n",
      "Java's List Interface The java.util.List interface is a subtype of the java.util.Collection interface. It represents an ordered list of objects, meaning you can access the elements of a List in a specific order, and by an index too. You can also add the same element more than once to a List . Here is a list of the topics covered in this text: List Implementations Adding and Accessing Elements Removing Elements Generic Lists More Details in the JavaDoc\n",
      "List Implementations Being a Collection subtype all methods in the Collection interface are also available in the List interface. Since List is an interface you need to instantiate a concrete implementation of the interface in order to use it. You can choose between the following List implementations in the Java Collections API: java.util.ArrayList java.util.LinkedList java.util.Vector java.util.Stack There are also List implementations in the java.util.concurrent package, but I will leave the concurrency utilities out of this tutorial. Here are a few examples of how to create a List instance: List listA = new ArrayList(); List listB = new LinkedList(); List listC = new Vector(); List listD = new Stack();\n",
      "Adding and Accessing Elements To add elements to a List you call its List.add() method. This method is inherited from the Collection interface. Here are a few examples: List listA = new ArrayList(); listA.add(\"element 1\"); listA.add(\"element 2\"); listA.add(\"element 3\"); listA.add(0, \"element 0\"); The first three List.add() calls add a String instance to the end of the list. The last List.add() call adds a String at index 0, meaning at the beginning of the list. The order in which the elements are added to the List is stored, so you can access the elements in the same order. You can do so using either the List.get(int index) method, or via the Iterator returned by the List.iterator() method. Here is how: List listA = new ArrayList(); listA.add(\"element 0\"); listA.add(\"element 1\"); listA.add(\"element 2\"); //access via index String element0 = listA.get(0); String element1 = listA.get(1); String element3 = listA.get(2); //access via Iterator Iterator iterator = listA.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext(){ String element = (String) iterator.next(); } //access via new for-loop for(Object object : listA) { String element = (String) object; } When iterating the list via its Iterator or via the for-loop (which also uses the Iterator behind the scene), the elements are iterated in the same sequence they are stored in the list.\n",
      "Removing Elements You can remove elements in two ways: remove(Object element) remove(int index) List.remove(Object element) removes that element in the list, if it is present. All subsequent elements in the list are then moved up in the list. Their index thus decreases by 1. List.remove(int index) removes the element at the given index. All subsequent elements in the list are then moved up in the list. Their index thus decreases by 1.\n",
      "Generic Lists By default you can put any Object into a List , but from Java 5, Java Generics makes it possible to limit the types of object you can insert into a List . Here is an example: List<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<MyObject>(); This List can now only have MyObject instances inserted into it. You can then access and iterate its elements without casting them. Here is how it looks: MyObject myObject = list.get(0); for(MyObject anObject : list){ //do someting to anObject... } For more information about Java Generics, see the Java Generics Tutorial.\n",
      "More Details in the JavaDoc There is a lot more you can do with a List , but you will have to check out the JavaDoc for more details. This text focused on the two most common operations: Adding / removing elements, and iterating the elements.\n",
      "Java Collections Overview In order to understand and use the Java Collections API effectively it is useful to have an overview of the interfaces it contains. So, that is what I will provide here. There are two \"groups\" of interfaces: Collection 's and Map 's. Here is a graphical overview of the Collection interface hierarchy: And here is a graphical overview of the Map interface hierarchy: You can find links to explanations of most (if not all) of these interfaces and implementations in the sub-menu at the top right of this page. That top-menu exists on all pages in this trail.\n",
      "Java's Iterable Interface The Iterable interface ( java.lang.Iterable ) is one of the root interfaces of the Java collection classes. The Collection interface extends Iterable , so all subtypes of Collection also implement the Iterable interface. A class that implements the Iterable can be used with the new for-loop. Here is such an example: List list = new ArrayList(); for(Object o : list){ //do something o; } The Iterable interface has only one method: public interface Iterable<T> { public Iterator<T> iterator(); } How you implement this Iterable interface so that you can use it with the new for-loop, is explained in the text Implementing the Iterable Interface, in my Java Generics tutorial.\n",
      "Sorting Java Collections You can sort List collections using the java.util.Collections.sort() method. You can sort these two types of List 's. List LinkedList\n",
      "Sorting Objects by their Natural Order To sort a List you do this: List list = new ArrayList(); //add elements to the list Collections.sort(list); When sorting a list like this the elements are ordered according to their \"natural order\". For objects to have a natural order they must implement the interface java.lang.Comparable . In other words, the objects must be comparable to determine their order. Here is how the Comparable interface looks: public interface Comparable<T> { int compareTo(T o); } The Comparable.compareTo() method should compare this object to another object, return an int value. Here are the rules for that int value: Return a negative value if this object is smaller than the other object Return 0 (zero) if this object is equal to the other object. Return a positive value if this object is larger than the other object. There are a few more specific rules to obey in the implementation, but the above is the primary requirements. Check out the JavaDoc for the details.\n",
      "Sorting Objects by their Natural Order - part 2 Let's say you are sorting a List of String elements. To sort them, each string is compared to the others according to some sorting algorithm (not interesting here). Each string compares itself to another string by alphabetic comparison. So, if a string is less than another string by alphabetic comparison it will return a negative number from the Comparable.compareTo() method. When you implement the Comparable.compareTo() method in your own classes you will have to decide how these objects should be compared to each other. For instance, Employee objects can be compared by their first name, last name, salary, start year or whatever else you think makes sense.\n",
      "Sorting Objects Using a Comparator Sometimes you may want to sort a list according to another order than their natural order. Perhaps the objects you are sorting do not even have a natural order. In that case you can use a Comparator instead. Here is how you sort a list using a Comparator : List list = new ArrayList(); //add elements to the list Comparator comparator = new SomeComparator(); Collections.sort(list, comparator); Notice how the Collections.sort() method now takes a java.util.Comparator as parameter in addition to the List . This Comparator compares the elements in the list two by two. Here is how the Comparator interface looks: public interface Comparator<T> { int compare(T object1, T object2); } The Comparator.compare() method compares two objects to each other and should: Return a negative value if object1 is smaller than object2 Return 0 (zero) if objec1 is equal to object2. Return a positive value if object1 is larger than object2. There are a few more requirements to the implementation of the Comparator.compare() method, but these are the primary requirements. Check out the JavaDoc for more specific details.\n",
      "Sorting Objects Using a Comparator - part 2 Here is an example Comparator that compares two fictive Employee objects: public class MyComparator<Employee> implements Comparator<Employee> { public int compare(Employee emp1, Employee emp2){ if(emp1.getSalary() < emp2.getSalary()) return -1; if(emp1.getSalary() == emp2.getSalary()) return 0; return 1; } } A shorter way to write the comparison would be like this: public class MyComparator<Employee> implements Comparator<Employee> { public int compare(Employee emp1, Employee emp2){ return emp1.getSalary() - emp2.getSalary(); } } By subtracting one salary from the other, the resulting value is automatically either negative, 0 or positive. Smart, right? If you want to compare objects by more than one factor, start by comparing by the first factor (e.g first name). Then, if the first factors are equal, compare by the second factor (e.g. last name, or salary) etc.\n",
      "Java's Map Interface The java.util.Map interface represents a mapping between a key and a value. The Map interface is not a subtype of the Collection interface. Therefore it behaves a bit different from the rest of the collection types. Here is a list of the topics covered in this text: Map Implementations Adding and Accessing Elements Removing Elements Generic Maps More Details in the JavaDoc\n",
      "Map Implementations Since Map is an interface you need to instantiate a concrete implementation of the interface in order to use it. You can choose between the following Map implementations in the Java Collections API: java.util.HashMap java.util.Hashtable java.util.EnumMap java.util.IdentityHashMap java.util.LinkedHashMap java.util.Properties java.util.TreeMap java.util.WeakHashMap In my experience, the most commonly used Map implementations are HashMap and TreeMap . Each of these Map implementations behaves a little differently with respect to the order of the elements when iterating the Map , and the time (big O notation) it takes to insert and access elements in the maps. HashMap maps a key and a value. It does not guarantee any order of the elements stored internally in the map. TreeMap also maps a key and a value. Furthermore it guarantees the order in which keys or values are iterated - which is the sort order of the keys or values. Check out the JavaDoc for more details. Here are a few examples of how to create a Map instance: Map mapA = new HashMap(); Map mapB = new TreeMap();\n",
      "Adding and Accessing Elements To add elements to a Map you call its Map.put() method. Here are a few examples: Map mapA = new HashMap(); mapA.put(\"key1\", \"element 1\"); mapA.put(\"key2\", \"element 2\"); mapA.put(\"key3\", \"element 3\"); The three Map.put() calls maps a string value to a string key. You can then obtain the value using the key. To do that you use the Map.get() method like this: String element1 = (String) mapA.get(\"key1\"); You can iterate either the keys or the values of a Map . Here is how you do that: // key iterator Iterator iterator = mapA.keySet().iterator(); // value iterator Iterator iterator = mapA.values(); Most often you iterate the keys of the Map and then get the corresponding values during the iteration. Here is how it looks: Iterator iterator = mapA.keySet().iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext(){ Object key = iterator.next(); Object value = mapA.get(key); } //access via new for-loop for(Object key : mapA.keySet()) { Object value = mapA.get(key); }\n",
      "Removing Elements You remove elements by calling the Map.remove(Object key) method. You thus remove the (key, value) pair matching the key.\n",
      "Generic Maps By default you can put any Object into a Map , but from Java 5, Java Generics makes it possible to limit the types of object you can use for both keys and values in a Map . Here is an example: Map<String, MyObject> map = new HashSet<String, MyObject>(); This Map can now only accept String objects for keys, and MyObject instances for values. You can then access and iterate keys and values without casting them. Here is how it looks: for(MyObject anObject : map.values()){ //do someting to anObject... } for(String key : map.keySet()){ MyObject value = map.get(key); //do something to value } For more information about Java Generics, see the Java Generics Tutorial.\n",

      "Java Set Example Here is first a simple Java Set example to give you a feel for how sets work: Set setA = new HashSet(); String element = \"element 1\"; setA.add(element); System.out.println( set.contains(element) ); This example creates a HashSet which is one of the classes in the Java APIs that implement the Set interface. Then it adds a string object to the set, and finally it checks if the set contains the element just added.\n",
      "Set Implementations Being a Collection subtype all methods in the Collection interface are also available in the Set interface. Since Set is an interface you need to instantiate a concrete implementation of the interface in order to use it. You can choose between the following Set implementations in the Java Collections API: java.util.EnumSet java.util.HashSet java.util.LinkedHashSet java.util.TreeSet Each of these Set implementations behaves a little differently with respect to the order of the elements when iterating the Set , and the time (big O notation) it takes to insert and access elements in the sets. HashSet is backed by a HashMap . It makes no guarantees about the sequence of the elements when you iterate them. LinkedHashSet differs from HashSet by guaranteeing that the order of the elements during iteration is the same as the order they were inserted into the LinkedHashSet . Reinserting an element that is already in the LinkedHashSet does not change this order.\n",
      "Set Implementations - part 2 TreeSet also guarantees the order of the elements when iterated, but the order is the sorting order of the elements. In other words, the order in which the elements whould be sorted if you used a Collections.sort() on a List or array containing these elements. This order is determined either by their natural order (if they implement Comparable ), or by a specific Comparator implementation. There are also Set implementations in the java.util.concurrent package, but I will leave the concurrency utilities out of this tutorial. Here are a few examples of how to create a Set instance: Set setA = new EnumSet(); Set setB = new HashSet(); Set setC = new LinkedHashSet(); Set setD = new TreeSet();\n",
      "Adding and Accessing Elements To add elements to a Set you call its Set.add() method. This method is inherited from the Collection interface. Here are a few examples: Set setA = new HashSet(); setA.add(\"element 1\"); setA.add(\"element 2\"); setA.add(\"element 3\"); The three Set.add() calls add a String instance to the set. When iterating the elements in the Set the order of the elements depends on what Set implementation you use, as mentioned earlier. Here is an iteration example: Set setA = new HashSet(); setA.add(\"element 0\"); setA.add(\"element 1\"); setA.add(\"element 2\"); //access via Iterator Iterator iterator = setA.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext(){ String element = (String) iterator.next(); } //access via new for-loop for(Object object : setA) { String element = (String) object; }\n",

      "Java's Queue Interface The java.util.Queue interface is a subtype of the java.util.Collection interface. It represents an ordered list of objects just like a List , but its intended use is slightly different. A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue. Just like a queue in a supermarket.

Here are a few examples: Queue queueA = new LinkedList(); queueA.add(\"element 1\"); queueA.add(\"element 2\"); queueA.add(\"element 3\"); The order in which the elements added to the Queue are stored internally, depends on the implementation. The same is true for the order in which elements are retrieved from the queue. You should consult the JavaDoc's for more information about the specific Queue implementations. You can peek at the element at the head of the queue without taking the element out of the queue. This is done via the Queue.element() method. Here is how that looks: Object firstElement = queueA.element(); To take the first element out of the queue, you use the Queue.remove() method which is described later. You can also iterate all elements of a queue, instead of just processing one at a time. Here is how that looks: Queue queueA = new LinkedList(); queueA.add(\"element 0\"); queueA.add(\"element 1\"); queueA.add(\"element 2\"); //access via Iterator Iterator iterator = queueA.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext(){ String element = (String) iterator.next(); } //access via new for-loop for(Object object : queueA) { String element = (String) object; } When iterating the queue via its Iterator or via the for-loop (which also uses the Iterator behind the scene, the sequence in which the elements are iterated depends on the queue implementation.\n",
      "Removing Elements To remove elements from a queue, you call the Queue.remove() method. This method removes the element at the head of the queue. In most Queue implementations the head and tail of the queue are at opposite ends. It is possible, however, to implement the Queue interface so that the head and tail of the queue is in the same end.

      "equals() equals() is used in most collections to determine if a collection contains a given element. For instance: List list = new ArrayList(); list.add(\"123\"); boolean contains123 = list.contains(\"123\"); The ArrayList iterates all its elements and execute \"123\".equals(element) to determine if the element is equal to the parameter object \"123\". It is the String.equals() implementation that determines if two strings are equal. The equals() method is also used when removing elements. For instance: List list = new ArrayList(); list.add(\"123\"); boolean removed = list.remove(\"123\"); The ArrayList again iterates all its elements and execute \"123\".equals(element) to determine if the element is equal to the parameter object \"123\". The first element it finds that is equal to the given parameter \"123\" is removed. As you can see, a proper implementation of .equals() is essential for your own classes to work well with the Java Collection classes. So how do you implement equals() \"properly\"?\n",
      "hashCode() The hashCode() method of objects is used when you insert them into a HashTable, HashMap or HashSet . If you do not know the theory of how a hashtable works internally, you can read about hastables on Wikipedia.org. When inserting an object into a hastable you use a key. The hash code of this key is calculated, and used to determine where to store the object internally. When you need to lookup an object in a hashtable you also use a key. The hash code of this key is calculated and used to determine where to search for the object. The hash code only points to a certain \"area\" (or list, bucket etc) internally. Since different key objects could potentially have the same hash code, the hash code itself is no guarantee that the right key is found. The hashtable then iterates this area (all keys with the same hash code) and uses the key's equals() method to find the right key. Once the right key is found, the object stored for that key is returned.\n",
      "Java Collections Tutorial The Java Collections API's provide Java developers with a set of classes and interfaces that makes it easier to handle collections of objects. In a sense Collection's works a bit like arrays, except their size can change dynamically, and they have more advanced behaviour than arrays. Rather than having to write your own collection classes, Java provides these ready-to-use collection classes for you. This tutorial will look closer at the Java Collection's, as they are also sometimes referred to, and more specifically the Java Collections available in Java 6. The purpose of this tutorial is to give you an overview of the Java Collection classes. Thus it will not describe each and every little detail of the Java Collection classes.

ArrayDeque stores its elements internally in an array. If the number of elements exceeds the space in the array, a new array is allocated, and all elements moved over. In other words, the ArrayDeque grows as needed, even if it stores its elements in an array.

Here is a list of the topics covered in this text: Collection Subtypes Adding and Removing Elements Checking if a Collection Contains a Certain Element Collection Size Iterating a Collection\n",
      "Adding and Removing Elements Regardless of what Collection subtype you are using there are a few standard methods to add and remove elements from a Collection. Adding and removing single elements is done like this: String anElement = \"an element\"; Collection collection = new HashSet(); boolean didCollectionChange = collection.add(anElement); boolean wasElementRemoved = collection.remove(anElement); Collection.add() adds the given element to the collection, and returns true if the Collection changed as a result of calling the Collection.add() method. A Set for instance may not have changed. If the Set already contained that element, it is not added again. On the other hand, if you called Collection.add() on a List and the List already contained that element, the element would then exist twice in the List . Collection.remove() removes the given element and returns true if the removed element was present in the Collection, and was removed. If the element was not present, the Collection.remove() method returns false.\n",
      "Adding and Removing Elements - part 2 You can also add and remove collections of objects. Here are a few examples: Set aSet = ... // get Set with elements from somewhere List aList = ... // get List with elements from somewhere Collection collection = new HashSet(); collection.addAll(aSet); //returns boolean too, but ignored here. collection.addAll(aList); //returns boolean too, but ignored here. collection.removeAll(aList); //returns boolean too... collection.retainAll(aSet); //returns boolean too... Collection.addAll() adds all elements found in the Collection passed as parameter to the method. The Collection object itself is not added. Only its elements. If you had called Collection.add() with the Collection as parameter instead, the Collection object itself would have been added, not its elements. Exactly how thet Collection.addAll() method behaves depends on the Collection subtype. Some Collection subtypes allows the same element to be added more than once, and others don't. Collection.removeAll() removes all elements found the Collection passed as parameter to the method. If the Collection parameter contains any elements not found the target collection, these are just ignored. Collection.retainAll() does the opposite of Collection.removeAll() . Instead of removing all the elements found in the parameter Collection, it keeps all these elements, and removes all other elements. Keep in mind, that only if the elements were already contained in the target collection, are they retained. Any new elements found in the parameter Collection which are not in the target collection, are not automatically added. They are just ignored.\n",
      "Checking if a Collection Contains a Certain Element The Collection interface has two methods to check if a Collection contains one or more certain elements. These are the Collection.contains() and Collection.containsAll() methods. They are illustrated here: Collection collection = new HashSet(); boolean containsElement = collection.contains(\"an element\"); Collection elements = new HashSet(); boolean containsAll = collection.containsAll(elements); Collection.contains() returns true if the collection contains the element, and false if not. Collection.containsAll() returns true if the collection contains all the elements in the parameter collection, and false if not.\n",

      "Java's SortedMap Interface The java.util.SortedMap interface is a subtype of the java.util.Map interface, with the addition that the elements stored in the map are sorted internally. The order of the sorting is either the natural sorting order of the elements (if they implement java.lang.Comparable ), or the order determined by a Comparator that you can give to the SortedSet . By default the elements are iterated in ascending order, starting with the \"smallest\" and moving towards the \"largest\". But it is also possible to iterate the elements in descending order using the method TreeMap.descendingKeySet() .

In Java 6 there is only one implementation of the NavigableSet interface in the java.util package: java.util.TreeSet There is an implementation in the java.util.concurrent package but that is outside the scope of this trail.

      "descendingIterator() and descendingSet() The first interesting navigation methods are the NavigableSet.descendingIterator() and NavigableSet.descendingSet() methods. The NavigableSet.descendingSet() method returns a NavigableSet in which the order of the elements is reversed compared to this one. The returned \"view\" is backed by the original NavigableSet , so changes to the descending set are also reflected in the original set. Here is a simple example: NavigableSet reverse = original.descendingSet(); The NavigableSet.descendingIterator() method allows you to iterate the elements of the NavigableSet (which is also a SortedSet ) in reverse order, without changing the order of the elements internally. Iterator reverse = original.descendingIterator();\n",
      "headSet(), tailSet() and subSet() The NavigableSet.headSet() method returns a view of the original NavigableSet which only contains elements that are \"less than\" the given element.

The NavigableSet.subSet() allows you to pass two parameters demarcating the boundaries of the view set to return. The elements matching the first boundary is included, where as elements matching the last boundary are not. Here is an example: NavigableSet original = new TreeSet(); original.add(\"1\"); original.add(\"2\"); original.add(\"3\"); original.add(\"4\"); original.add(\"5\"); //this subset will contain \"2\" and \"3\" SortedSet subset = original.subSet(\"2\", \"4\"); //this subset will contain \"2\", \"3\" and \"4\" because // fromInclusive=true, and toInclusive=true NavigableSet subset = original.subSet(\"2\", true, \"4\", true);\n",
      "ceiling(), floor(), higher(), and lower() The NavigableSet.ceiling() method returns the least (smallest) element in this set that is greater than or equal to the element passed as parameter to the NavigableSet.ceiling() method.

Object ceiling = original.ceiling(\"2\"); //floor will be \"2\". Object floor = original.floor(\"2\"); The NavigableSet.floor() method does the opposite of NavigableSet.ceiling() The NavigableSet.higher() method returns the least (smallest) element in this set that is greater than (not equal too) the element passed as parameter to the NavigableSet.higher() method. Here is an example: NavigableSet original = new TreeSet(); original.add(\"1\"); original.add(\"2\"); original.add(\"3\"); //higher will be \"3\". Object higher = original.higher(\"2\"); //lower will be \"1\" Object lower = original.lower(\"2\"); The NavigableSet.lower() method does the opposite of the NavigableSet.higher() method.\n",
      "pollFirst() and pollLast() The NavigableSet.pollFirst() method returns and removes the \"first\" element in the NavigableSet or null if the set is empty. The NavigableSet.pollLast() returns and removes the \"last\" element in the set or null if the set is empty. \"First\" means smallest element according to the sort order of the set. \"Last\" means largest according to teh element sorting order of the set. Here are two examples: NavigableSet original = new TreeSet(); original.add(\"1\"); original.add(\"2\"); original.add(\"3\"); //first is \"1\" Object first = original.pollFirst(); //last is \"3\" Object last = original.pollLast();\n",

The Collection interface can be generified like this: Collection<String> stringCollection = new HashSet<String>(); This stringCollection can now only contain String instances. If you try to add anything else, or cast the elements in the collection to any other type than String , the compiler will complain. Actually, it is possible to insert other objects than String objects, if you cheat a little (or is just plain stupid), but this is not recommended. You can iterate the above collection using the new for-loop, like this: Collection<String> stringCollection = new HashSet<String>(); for(String stringElement : stringCollection) { //do something with each stringElement } You can do the same thing with List's , Set's etc. I won't get into much more detail about generic collections here. Like I said in the beginning, I have a separate Java Generics tutorial. Additionally, more generic examples will be shown in the texts on the specific collection types.\n",

      "Introduction Joda Time is like an iceberg, 9/10ths of it is invisible to user-code. Many, perhaps most, applications will never need to see what's below the surface. This document provides an introduction to the Joda-Time API for the average user, not for the would-be API developer. The bulk of the text is devoted to code snippets that display the most common usage scenarios in which the library classes are used. In particular, we cover the usage of the key DateTime, Interval, Duration and Period classes. We finish with a look at the important topic of formatting and parsing and a few more advanced topics.\n",
      "Instants The most frequently used concept in Joda-Time is that of the instant. An Instant is defined as a moment in the datetime continuum specified as a number of milliseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00Z. This definition of milliseconds is consistent with that of the JDK in Date or Calendar. Interoperating between the two APIs is thus simple. Within Joda-Time an instant is represented by the ReadableInstant interface. The main implementation of this interface, and the class that the average API user needs to be most familiar with, is DateTime. DateTime is immutable - and once created the values do not change. Thus, this class can safely be passed around and used in multiple threads without synchronization. The millisecond instant can be converted to any date time field using a Chronology. To assist with this, methods are provided on DateTime that act as getters for the most common date and time fields. We discuss the chronology concept a litte further on in this overview. A companion mutable class to DateTime is MutableDateTime. Objects of this class can be modified and are not thread-safe. Other implementations of ReadableInstant include Instant and DateMidnight.\n",
      "Fields The main API of DateTime has been kept small, limited to just get methods for each calendar field. So, for instance, the 'day-of-year' calendar field would be retrieved by calling the getDayOfYear() method. For a complete list of fields and their descriptions, see the field reference.\n",
      "Properties There is much more power available, however, through the use of what is termed a property. Each calendar field is associated with such a property. Thus, 'day-of-year', whose value is directly returned by the method getDayOfYear(), is also associated with the property returned by the dayOfYear() method. The property class associated with DateTime is DateTime.Property. Knowing the methods on the property is the secret to making the most of the API. We have more to say on the usage of properties later in this document.\n",
      "Intervals An Interval in Joda-Time represents an interval of time from one instant to another instant. Both instants are fully specified instants in the datetime continuum, complete with time zone. Intervals are implemented as half-open, which is to say that the start instant is inclusive but the end instant is exclusive. The end is always greater than or equal to the start. Both end-points are restricted to having the same chronology and the same time zone. Two implementations are provided, Interval and MutableInterval, both are specializations of ReadableInterval.\n",
      "Durations A Duration in Joda-Time represents a duration of time measured in milliseconds. The duration is often obtained from an interval. Durations are a very simple concept, and the implementation is also simple. They have no chronology or time zone, and consist solely of the millisecond duration. Durations can be added to an instant, or to either end of an interval to change those objects. In datetime maths you could say: instant + duration = instant Currently, there is only one implementation of the ReadableDuration interface: Duration.\n",
      "Periods A Period in Joda-Time represents a period of time defined in terms of fields, for example, 3 years 5 months 2 days and 7 hours. This differs from a duration in that it is inexact in terms of milliseconds. A period can only be resolved to an exact number of milliseconds by specifying the instant (including chronology and time zone) it is relative to. For example, consider a period of 1 month. If you add this period to the 1st February (ISO) then you will get the 1st March. If you add the same period to the 1st March you will get the 1st April. But the duration added (in milliseconds) in these two cases is very different. As a second example, consider adding 1 day at the daylight savings boundary. If you use a period to do the addition then either 23 or 25 hours will be added as appropriate. If you had created a duration equal to 24 hours, then you would end up with the wrong result. Periods are implemented as a set of int fields. The standard set of fields in a period are years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds and millis. The PeriodType class allows this set of fields to be restricted, for example to elimate weeks. This is significant when converting a duration or interval to a period, as the calculation needs to know which period fields it should populate. Methods exist on periods to obtain each field value. Periods are not associated with either a chronology or a time zone. Periods can be added to an instant, or to either end of an interval to change those objects. In datetime maths you could say: instant + period = instant There are two implementations of the ReadablePeriod interface, Period and MutablePeriod.\n",
      "Chronology The Joda-Time design is based around the Chronology. It is a calculation engine that supports the complex rules for a calendar system. It encapsulates the field objects, which are used on demand to split the absolute time instant into recognisable calendar fields like 'day-of-week'. It is effectively a pluggable calendar system. The actual calculations of the chronology are split between the Chronology class itself and the field classes - DateTimeField and DurationField. Together, the subclasses of these three classes form the bulk of the code in the library. Most users will never need to use or refer directly to the subclasses. Instead, they will simply obtain the chronology and use it as a singleton, as follows: Chronology coptic = CopticChronology.getInstance(), Internally, all the chronology, field, etc. classes are maintained as singletons. Thus there is an initial setup cost when using Joda-Time, but after that only the main API instance classes (DateTime, Interval, Period, etc.) have creation and garbage collector costs. Although the Chronology is key to the design, it is not key to using the API !! For most applications, the Chronology can be ignored as it will default to the ISOChronology. This is suitable for most uses. You would change it if you need accurate dates before October 15, 1582, or whenever the Julian calendar ceased in the territory you're interested in). You'd also change it if you need a specific calendar like the Coptic calendar illustrated earlier.\n",
      "Interface usage As you have seen, Joda-Time defines a number of new interfaces which are visible throughout the javadocs. The most important is ReadableInstant which currently has 4 implementations. Other significant interfaces include ReadableInterval and ReadablePeriod. These are currently used as generalizations for a value-only and a mutable class, respectively. An important point to mention here is that the Joda interfaces are used differently than, for instance, the JDK Collections Framework interfaces. When working with a Collections interface, such as List or Map you will normally hold your variable as a type of List or Map, only referencing the concrete class when you create the object. List list = new ArrayList(), Map map = new HashMap(), In Joda-Time, the interfaces exist to allow interoperation between similar date implementations, such as a mutable and immutable version of a class. As such, they only offer a subset of the methods of the concrete class. For most work, you will reference the concrete class, not the interface. This gives access to the full power of the library. DateTime dt = new DateTime(), For maximum flexibility however, you might choose to declare your method parameters using the Joda-Time interface. A method on the interface can obtain the concrete class for use within the method. public void process(ReadableDateTime dateTime) { DateTime dt = dateTime.toDateTime(), }\n",
      "Construction A datetime object is created by using a DateTime constructor. The default constructor is used as follows DateTime dt = new DateTime(), and creates a datetime object representing the current date and time in milliseconds as determined by the system clock. It is constructed using the ISO calendar in the default time zone. To create a datetime object representing a specific date and time, you may use an initialization string: DateTime dt = new DateTime(\",2004-12-13T21:39:45.618-08:00\",), The initialization string must be in a format that is compatible with the ISO8601 standard. DateTime also provides other constructors to create a specific date and time using a variety of standard fields. This also permits the use of any calendar and timezone.\n",
      "JDK Interoperability The DateTime class has a constructor which takes an Object as input. In particular this constructor can be passed a JDK Date, JDK Calendar or JDK GregorianCalendar (It also accepts an ISO8601 formatted String, or Long object representing milliseconds). This is one half of the interoperability with the JDK. The other half of interoperability with JDK is provided by DateTime methods which return JDK objects. Thus inter-conversion between Joda DateTime and JDK Date can be performed as follows // from Joda to JDK DateTime dt = new DateTime(), Date jdkDate = dt.toDate(), // from JDK to Joda dt = new DateTime(jdkDate), Similarly, for JDK Calendar: // from Joda to JDK DateTime dt = new DateTime(), Calendar jdkCal = dt.toCalendar(Locale.CHINESE), // from JDK to Joda dt = new DateTime(jdkCal), and JDK GregorianCalendar: // from Joda to JDK DateTime dt = new DateTime(), GregorianCalendar jdkGCal = dt.toGregorianCalendar(), // from JDK to Joda dt = new DateTime(jdkGCal),\n",
      "Querying DateTimes The separation of the calculation of calendar fields (DateTimeField) from the representation of the calendar instant (DateTime) makes for a powerful and flexible API. The connection between the two is maintained by the property (DateTime.Property) which provides access to the field. For instance, the direct way to get the day of week for a particular DateTime, involves calling the method int iDoW = dt.getDayOfWeek(), where iDoW can take the values (from class DateTimeConstants). public static final int MONDAY = 1, public static final int TUESDAY = 2, public static final int WEDNESDAY = 3, public static final int THURSDAY = 4, public static final int FRIDAY = 5, public static final int SATURDAY = 6, public static final int SUNDAY = 7,\n",
      "Accessing fields The direct methods are fine for simple usage, but more flexibility can be achieved via the property/field mechanism. The day of week property is obtained by DateTime.Property pDoW = dt.dayOfWeek(), which can be used to get richer information about the field, such as String strST = pDoW.getAsShortText(), // returns \",Mon\",, \",Tue\",, etc. String strT = pDoW.getAsText(), // returns \",Monday\",, \",Tuesday\",, etc. which return short and long name strings (based on the current locale) of the day-of-week. Localized versions of these methods are also available, thus String strTF = pDoW.getAsText(Locale.FRENCH), // returns \",Lundi\",, etc. can be used to return the day-of-week name string in French. Of course, the original integer value of the field is still accessible as iDoW = pDoW.get(), The property also provides access to other values associated with the field such as metadata on the minimum and maximum text size, leap status, related durations, etc. For a complete reference, see the documentation for the base class AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty In practice, one would not actually create the intermediate pDoW variable. The code is easier to read if the methods are called on anonymous intermediate objects. Thus, for example, strT = dt.dayOfWeek().getAsText(), iDoW = dt.dayOfWeek().get(), would be written instead of the more indirect code presented earlier. Note: For the single case of getting the numerical value of a field, we recommend using the get method on the main DateTime object as it is more efficient. iDoW = dt.getDayOfWeek(),\n",
      "Date fields The DateTime implementation provides a complete list of standard calendar fields: dt.getEra(), dt.getYear(), dt.getWeekyear(), dt.getCenturyOfEra(), dt.getYearOfEra(), dt.getYearOfCentury(), dt.getMonthOfYear(), dt.getWeekOfWeekyear(), dt.getDayOfYear(), dt.getDayOfMonth(), dt.getDayOfWeek(), Each of these also has a corresponding property method, which returns a DateTime.Property binding to the appropriate field, such as year() or monthOfYear(). The fields represented by these properties behave pretty much as their names would suggest. The precise definitions are available in the field reference. As you would expect, all the methods we showed above in the day-of-week example can be applied to any of these properties. For example, to extract the standard month, day and year fields from a datetime, we can write String month = dt.monthOfYear().getAsText(), int maxDay = dt.dayOfMonth().getMaximumValue(), boolean leapYear = dt.yearOfEra().isLeap(),\n",
      "Time fields Another set of properties access fields representing intra-day durations for time calculations. Thus to compute the hours, minutes and seconds of the instant represented by a DateTime, we would write int hour = dt.getHourOfDay(), int min = dt.getMinuteOfHour(), int sec = dt.getSecondOfMinute(), Again each of these has a corresponding property method for more complex manipulation. The complete list of time fields can be found in the field reference.\n",
      "Manipulating DateTimes DateTime objects have value semantics, and cannot be modified after construction (they are immutable). Therefore, most simple manipulation of a datetime object involves construction of a new datetime as a modified copy of the original. WARNING: A common mistake to make with immutable classes is to forget to assign the result to a variable. Remember that calling an add or set method on an immtable object has no effect on that object - only the result is updated.\n",
      "Modifying fields One way to do this is to use methods on properties. To return to our prior example, if we wish to modify the dt object by changing its day-of-week field to Monday we can do so by using the setCopy method of the property: DateTime result = dt.dayOfWeek().setCopy(DateTimeConstants.MONDAY), Note: If the DateTime object is already set to Monday then the same object will be returned. To add to a date you could use the addToCopy method. DateTime result = dt.dayOfWeek().addToCopy(3),\n",
      "DateTime methods Another means of accomplishing similar calculations is to use methods on the DateTime object itself. Thus we could add 3 days to dt directly as follows: DateTime result = dt.plusDays(3),\n",
      "Using a MutableDateTime The methods outlined above are suitable for simple calculations involving one or two fields. In situations where multiple fields need to be modified, it is more efficient to create a mutable copy of the datetime, modify the copy and finally create a new value datetime. MutableDateTime mdt = dt.toMutableDateTime(), // perform various calculations on mdt ... DateTime result = mdt.toDateTime(), MutableDateTime has a number of methods, including standard setters, for directly modifying the datetime.\n",
      "Changing TimeZone DateTime comes with support for a couple of common timezone calculations. For instance, if you want to get the local time in London at this very moment, you would do the following // get current moment in default time zone DateTime dt = new DateTime(), // translate to London local time DateTime dtLondon = dt.withZone(DateTimeZone.forID(\",Europe/London\",)), where DateTimeZone.forID(\",Europe/London\",) returns the timezone value for London. The resulting value dtLondon has the same absolute millisecond time, but a different set of field values. There is also support for the reverse operation, i.e. to get the datetime (absolute millisecond) corresponding to the moment when London has the same local time as exists in the default time zone now. This is done as follows // get current moment in default time zone DateTime dt = new DateTime(), // find the moment when London will have / had the same time dtLondonSameTime = dt.withZoneRetainFields(DateTimeZone.forID(\",Europe/London\",)), A set of all TimeZone ID strings (such as \",Europe/London\",) may be obtained by calling DateTimeZone.getAvailableIDs(). A full list of available time zones is provided here.\n",
      "Changing Chronology The DateTime class also has one method for changing calendars. This allows you to change the calendar for a given moment in time. Thus if you want to get the datetime for the current time, but in the Buddhist Calendar, you would do // get current moment in default time zone DateTime dt = new DateTime(), dt.getYear(), // returns 2004 // change to Buddhist chronology DateTime dtBuddhist = dt.withChronology(BuddhistChronology.getInstance()), dtBuddhist.getYear(), // returns 2547 where BuddhistChronology.getInstance() is a factory method for obtaining a Buddhist chronology.\n",
      "Formatters All printing and parsing is performed using a DateTimeFormatter object. Given such an object fmt, parsing is performed as follows String strInputDateTime, // string is populated with a date time string in some fashion ... DateTime dt = fmt.parseDateTime(strInputDateTime), Thus a DateTime object is returned from the parse method of the formatter. Similarly, output is performed as String strOutputDateTime = fmt.print(dt),\n",
      "Standard Formatters Support for standard formats based on ISO8601 is provided by the ISODateTimeFormat class. This provides a number of factory methods. For example, if you wanted to use the ISO standard format for datetime, which is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ, you would initialize fmt as DateTimeFormatter fmt = ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime(), You would then use fmt as described above, to read or write datetime objects in this format.\n",
      "Custom Formatters If you need a custom formatter which can be described in terms of a format pattern, you can use the factory method provided by the DateTimeFormat class. Thus to get a formatter for a 4 digit year, 2 digit month and 2 digit day of month, i.e. a format of yyyyMMdd you would do DateTimeFormatter fmt = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(\",yyyyMMdd\",), The pattern string is compatible with JDK date patterns. You may need to print or parse in a particular Locale. This is achieved by calling the withLocale method on a formatter, which returns another formatter based on the original. DateTimeFormatter fmt = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(\",yyyyMMdd\",), DateTimeFormatter frenchFmt = fmt.withLocale(Locale.FRENCH), DateTimeFormatter germanFmt = fmt.withLocale(Locale.GERMAN), Formatters are immutable, so the original is not altered by the withLocale method.\n",
      "Freaky Formatters Finally, if you have a format that is not easily represented by a pattern string, Joda Time architecture exposes a builder class that can be used to build a custom formatter which is programatically defined. Thus if you wanted a formatter to print and parse dates of the form \",22-Jan-65\",, you could do the following: DateTimeFormatter fmt = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder() .appendDayOfMonth(2) .appendLiteral('-') .appendMonthOfYearShortText() .appendLiteral('-') .appendTwoDigitYear(1956) // pivot = 1956 .toFormatter(), Each append method appends a new field to be parsed/printed to the calling builder and returns a new builder. The final toFormatter method creates the actual formatter that will be used to print/parse. What is particularly interesting about this format is the two digit year. Since the interpretation of a two digit year is ambiguous, the appendTwoDigitYear takes an extra parameter that defines the 100 year range of the two digits, by specifying the mid point of the range. In this example the range will be (1956 - 50) = 1906, to (1956 + 49) = 2005. Thus 04 will be 2004 but 07 will be 1907. This kind of conversion is not possible with ordinary format strings, highlighting the power of the Joda time formatting architecture.\n",
      "Direct access To simplify the access to the formatter architecture, methods have been provided on the datetime classes such as DateTime. DateTime dt = new DateTime(), String a = dt.toString(), String b = dt.toString(\",dd:MM:yy\",), String c = dt.toString(\",EEE\",, Locale.FRENCH), DateTimeFormatter fmt = ..., String d = dt.toString(fmt), Each of the four results demonstrates a different way to use the formatters. Result a is the standard ISO8601 string for the DateTime. Result b will output using the pattern 'dd:MM:yy' (note that patterns are cached internally). Result c will output using the pattern 'EEE' in French. Result d will output using the specified formatter, and is thus the same as fmt.print(dt).\n",
      "Change the Current Time Joda-Time allows you to change the current time. All methods that get the current time are indirected via DateTimeUtils. This allows the current time to be changed, which can be very useful for testing. // always return the same time when querying current time DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisFixed(millis), // offset the real time DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisOffset(millis), Note that changing the current time this way does not affect the system clock.\n",
      "Converters The constructors on each major concrete class in the API take an Object as a parameter. This is passed to the converter subsystem which is responsible for converting the object to one acceptable to Joda-Time. For example, the converters can convert a JDK Date object to a DateTime. If required, you can add your own converters to those supplied in Joda-Time.\n",
      "Security Joda-Time includes hooks into the standard JDK security scheme for sensitive changes. These include changing the time zone handler, changing the current time and changing the converters. See JodaTimePermission for details.\n",

      "4.3 Root-finding UnivariateSolver , UnivariateDifferentiableSolver and PolynomialSolver provide means to find roots of univariate real-valued functions, differentiable univariate real-valued functions, and polynomial functions respectively. A root is the value where the function takes the value 0. Commons-Math includes implementations of the several root-finding algorithms: Root solvers Name Function type Convergence Needs initial bracketing Bracket side selection Bisection univariate real-valued functions linear, guaranteed yes yes Brent-Dekker univariate real-valued functions super-linear, guaranteed yes no bracketing nth order Brent univariate real-valued functions variable order, guaranteed yes yes Illinois Method univariate real-valued functions super-linear, guaranteed yes yes Laguerre's Method polynomial functions cubic for simple root, linear for multiple root yes no Muller's Method using bracketing to deal with real-valued functions univariate real-valued functions quadratic close to roots yes no Muller's Method using modulus to deal with real-valued functions univariate real-valued functions quadratic close to root yes no Newton-Raphson's Method differentiable univariate real-valued functions quadratic, non-guaranteed no no Pegasus Method univariate real-valued functions super-linear, guaranteed yes yes Regula Falsi (false position) Method univariate real-valued functions linear, guaranteed yes yes Ridder's Method univariate real-valued functions super-linear yes no Secant Method univariate real-valued functions super-linear, non-guaranteed yes no\n",
      "4.3 Root-finding - part 4 In order to use the root-finding features, first a solver object must be created by calling its constructor, often providing relative and absolute accuracy. Using a solver object, roots of functions are easily found using the BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver.solve methods. These methods takes a maximum iteration count maxEval, a function f, and either two domain values, min and max, or a startValue as parameters. If the maximal number of iterations count is exceeded, non-convergence is assumed and a ConvergenceException exception is thrown. A suggested value is 100, which should be plenty, given that a bisection algorithm can't get any more accurate after 52 iterations because of the number of mantissa bits in a double precision floating point number. If a number of ill-conditioned problems is to be solved, this number can be decreased in order to avoid wasting time. Bracketed solvers also take an allowed solution enum parameter to specify which side of the final convergence interval should be selected as the root. It can be ANY_SIDE, LEFT_SIDE, RIGHT_SIDE, BELOW_SIDE or ABOVE_SIDE. Left and right are used to specify the root along the function parameter axis while below and above refer to the function value axis. The solve methods compute a value c such that: f(c) = 0.0 (see \"function value accuracy\") min <= c <= max (except for the secant method, which may find a solution outside the interval)\n",
      "4.3 Root-finding - part 5 Typical usage: UnivariateFunction function = // some user defined function object final double relativeAccuracy = 1.0e-12; final double absoluteAccuracy = 1.0e-8; final int maxOrder = 5; UnivariateSolver solver = new BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver(relativeAccuracy, absoluteAccuracy, maxOrder); double c = solver.solve(100, function, 1.0, 5.0, AllowedSolution.LEFT_SIDE); Force bracketing, by refining a base solution found by a non-bracketing solver: UnivariateFunction function = // some user defined function object final double relativeAccuracy = 1.0e-12; final double absoluteAccuracy = 1.0e-8; UnivariateSolver nonBracketing = new BrentSolver(relativeAccuracy, absoluteAccuracy); double baseRoot = nonBracketing.solve(100, function, 1.0, 5.0); double c = UnivariateSolverUtils.forceSide(100, function, new PegasusSolver(relativeAccuracy, absoluteAccuracy), baseRoot, 1.0, 5.0, AllowedSolution.LEFT_SIDE); The BrentSolver uses the Brent-Dekker algorithm which is fast and robust. If there are multiple roots in the interval, or there is a large domain of indeterminacy, the algorithm will converge to a random root in the interval without indication that there are problems. Interestingly, the examined text book implementations all disagree in details of the convergence criteria. Also each implementation had problems for one of the test cases, so the expressions had to be fudged further. Don't expect to get exactly the same root values as for other implementations of this algorithm. The BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver uses an extension of the Brent-Dekker algorithm which uses inverse nth order polynomial interpolation instead of inverse quadratic interpolation, and which allows selection of the side of the convergence interval for result bracketing. This is now the recommended algorithm for most users since it has the largest order, doesn't require derivatives, has guaranteed convergence and allows result bracket selection.\n",
      "4.3 Root-finding - part 6 The SecantSolver uses a straightforward secant algorithm which does not bracket the search and therefore does not guarantee convergence. It may be faster than Brent on some well-behaved functions. The RegulaFalsiSolver is variation of secant preserving bracketing, but then it may be slow, as one end point of the search interval will become fixed after and only the other end point will converge to the root, hence resulting in a search interval size that does not decrease to zero. The IllinoisSolver and PegasusSolver are well-known variations of regula falsi that fix the problem of stuck end points by slightly weighting one endpoint to balance the interval at next iteration. Pegasus is often faster than Illinois. Pegasus may be the algorithm of choice for selecting a specific side of the convergence interval. The BisectionSolver is included for completeness and for establishing a fall back in cases of emergency. The algorithm is simple, most likely bug free and guaranteed to converge even in very adverse circumstances which might cause other algorithms to malfunction. The drawback is of course that it is also guaranteed to be slow.\n",
      "4.3 Root-finding - part 7 The UnivariateSolver interface exposes many properties to control the convergence of a solver. The accuracy properties are set at solver instance creation and cannot be changed afterwards, there are only getters to retriveve their values, no setters are available. Property Purpose Absolute accuracy The Absolute Accuracy is (estimated) maximal difference between the computed root and the true root of the function. This is what most people think of as \"accuracy\" intuitively. The default value is chosen as a sane value for most real world problems, for roots in the range from -100 to +100. For accurate computation of roots near zero, in the range form -0.0001 to +0.0001, the value may be decreased. For computing roots much larger in absolute value than 100, the default absolute accuracy may never be reached because the given relative accuracy is reached first. Relative accuracy The Relative Accuracy is the maximal difference between the computed root and the true root, divided by the maximum of the absolute values of the numbers. This accuracy measurement is better suited for numerical calculations with computers, due to the way floating point numbers are represented. The default value is chosen so that algorithms will get a result even for roots with large absolute values, even while it may be impossible to reach the given absolute accuracy. Function value accuracy This value is used by some algorithms in order to prevent numerical instabilities. If the function is evaluated to an absolute value smaller than the Function Value Accuracy, the algorithms assume they hit a root and return the value immediately. The default value is a \"very small value\". If the goal is to get a near zero function value rather than an accurate root, computation may be sped up by setting this value appropriately.\n",
      "4.4 Interpolation A UnivariateInterpolator is used to find a univariate real-valued function f which for a given set of ordered pairs (xi,yi) yields f(xi)=yi to the best accuracy possible. The result is provided as an object implementing the UnivariateFunction interface. It can therefore be evaluated at any point, including point not belonging to the original set. Currently, only an interpolator for generating natural cubic splines and a polynomial interpolator are available. There is no interpolator factory, mainly because the interpolation algorithm is more determined by the kind of the interpolated function rather than the set of points to interpolate. There aren't currently any accuracy controls either, as interpolation accuracy is in general determined by the algorithm. Typical usage: double x[] = { 0.0, 1.0, 2.0 }; double y[] = { 1.0, -1.0, 2.0); UnivariateInterpolator interpolator = new SplineInterpolator(); UnivariateFunction function = interpolator.interpolate(x, y); double interpolationX = 0.5; double interpolatedY = function.evaluate(x); System.out println(\"f(\" + interpolationX + \") = \" + interpolatedY); A natural cubic spline is a function consisting of a polynomial of third degree for each subinterval determined by the x-coordinates of the interpolated points. A function interpolating N value pairs consists of N-1 polynomials. The function is continuous, smooth and can be differentiated twice. The second derivative is continuous but not smooth. The x values passed to the interpolator must be ordered in ascending order. It is not valid to evaluate the function for values outside the range x0..xN.\n",
      "4.4 Interpolation - part 3 Microsphere interpolation is a robust multidimensional interpolation algorithm. It has been described in William Dudziak's MS thesis. Hermite interpolation is an interpolation method that can use derivatives in addition to function values at sample points. The HermiteInterpolator class implements this method for vector-valued functions. The sampling points can have any spacing (there are no requirements for a regular grid) and some points may provide derivatives while others don't provide them (or provide derivatives to a smaller order). Points are added one at a time, as shown in the following example: HermiteInterpolator interpolator = new HermiteInterpolator; // at x = 0, we provide both value and first derivative interpolator.addSamplePoint(0.0, new double[] { 1.0 }, new double[] { 2.0 }); // at x = 1, we provide only function value interpolator.addSamplePoint(1.0, new double[] { 4.0 }); // at x = 2, we provide both value and first derivative interpolator.addSamplePoint(2.0, new double[] { 5.0 }, new double[] { 2.0 }); // should print \"value at x = 0.5: 2.5625\" System.out.println(\"value at x = 0.5: \" + interpolator.value(0.5)[0]); // should print \"derivative at x = 0.5: 3.5\" System.out.println(\"derivative at x = 0.5: \" + interpolator.derivative(0.5)[0]); // should print \"interpolation polynomial: 1 + 2 x + 4 x^2 - 4 x^3 + x^4\" System.out.println(\"interpolation polynomial: \" + interpolator.getPolynomials()[0]); A BivariateGridInterpolator is used to find a bivariate real-valued function f which for a given set of tuples (xi,yj,fij) yields f(xi,yj)=fij to the best accuracy possible. The result is provided as an object implementing the BivariateFunction interface. It can therefore be evaluated at any point, including a point not belonging to the original set. The arrays xi and yj must be sorted in increasing order in order to define a two-dimensional grid.\n",
      "4.4 Interpolation - part 4 In bicubic interpolation, the interpolation function is a 3rd-degree polynomial of two variables. The coefficients are computed from the function values sampled on a grid, as well as the values of the partial derivatives of the function at those grid points. From two-dimensional data sampled on a grid, the BicubicSplineInterpolator computes a bicubic interpolating function. Prior to computing an interpolating function, the SmoothingPolynomialBicubicSplineInterpolator class performs smoothing of the data by computing the polynomial that best fits each of the one-dimensional curves along each of the coordinate axes. A TrivariateGridInterpolator is used to find a trivariate real-valued function f which for a given set of tuples (xi,yj,zk, fijk) yields f(xi,yj,zk)=fijk to the best accuracy possible. The result is provided as an object implementing the TrivariateFunction interface. It can therefore be evaluated at any point, including a point not belonging to the original set. The arrays xi, yj and zk must be sorted in increasing order in order to define a three-dimensional grid.\n",
      "4.4 Interpolation - part 5 In tricubic interpolation, the interpolation function is a 3rd-degree polynomial of three variables. The coefficients are computed from the function values sampled on a grid, as well as the values of the partial derivatives of the function at those grid points. From three-dimensional data sampled on a grid, the TricubicSplineInterpolator computes a tricubic interpolating function.\n",
      "4.5 Integration A UnivariateIntegrator provides the means to numerically integrate univariate real-valued functions. Commons-Math includes implementations of the following integration algorithms: Romberg's method Simpson's method trapezoid method Legendre-Gauss method\n",
      "4.6 Polynomials The org.apache.commons.math3.analysis.polynomials package provides real coefficients polynomials. The PolynomialFunction class is the most general one, using traditional coefficients arrays. The PolynomialsUtils utility class provides static factory methods to build Chebyshev, Hermite, Jacobi, Laguerre and Legendre polynomials. Coefficients are computed using exact fractions so these factory methods can build polynomials up to any degree.\n",
      "4.7 Differentiation The org.apache.commons.math3.analysis.differentiation package provides a general-purpose differentiation framework. The core class is DerivativeStructure which holds the value and the differentials of a function. This class handles some arbitrary number of free parameters and arbitrary derivation order. It is used both as the input and the output type for the UnivariateDifferentiableFunction interface. Any differentiable function should implement this interface. The main idea behind the DerivativeStructure class is that it can be used almost as a number (i.e. it can be added, multiplied, its square root can be extracted or its cosine computed... However, in addition to computed the value itself when doing these computations, the partial derivatives are also computed alongside. This is an extension of what is sometimes called Rall's numbers. This extension is described in Dan Kalman's paper Doubly Recursive Multivariate Automatic Differentiation, Mathematics Magazine, vol. 75, no. 3, June 2002. Rall's numbers only hold the first derivative with respect to one free parameter whereas Dan Kalman's derivative structures hold all partial derivatives up to any specified order, with respect to any number of free parameters. Rall's numbers therefore can be seen as derivative structures for order one derivative and one free parameter, and primitive real numbers can be seen as derivative structures with zero order derivative and no free parameters.\n",
      "4.7 Differentiation - part 2 The workflow of computation of a derivatives of an expression y=f(x) is the following one. First we configure an input parameter x of type DerivativeStructure so it will drive the function to compute all derivatives up to order 3 for example. Then we compute y=f(x) normally by passing this parameter to the f function.At the end, we extract from y the value and the derivatives we want. As we have specified 3rd order when we built x, we can retrieve the derivatives up to 3rd order from y. The following example shows that (the 0 parameter in the DerivativeStructure constructor will be explained in the next paragraph): int params = 1; int order = 3; double xRealValue = 2.5; DerivativeStructure x = new DerivativeStructure(params, order, 0, xRealValue); DerivativeStructure y = f(x); System.out.println(\"y = \" + y.getValue(); System.out.println(\"y' = \" + y.getPartialDerivative(1); System.out.println(\"y'' = \" + y.getPartialDerivative(2); System.out.println(\"y''' = \" + y.getPartialDerivative(3);\n",
      "4.7 Differentiation - part 4 When we compute y from this setting, what we really do is chain f after the identity function, so the net result is that the derivatives are computed with respect to the indexed free parameters (i.e. only free parameter number 0 here since there is only one free parameter) of the identity function x. Going one step further, if we compute z = g(y), we will also compute z as a function of the initial free parameter. The very important consequence is that if we call z.DerivativeStructure.getPartialDerivative(1) , we will not get the first derivative of g with respect to y, but with respect to the free parameter p0: the derivatives of g and f will be chained together automatically, without user intervention. This design choice is a very classical one in many algorithmic differentiation frameworks, either based on operator overloading (like the one we implemented here) or based on code generation. It implies the user has to bootstrap the system by providing initial derivatives, and this is essentially done by setting up identity function, i.e. functions that represent the variables themselves and have only unit first derivative.\n",
      "4.7 Differentiation - part 5 This design also allow a very interesting feature which can be explained with the following example. Suppose we have a two arguments function f and a one argument function g. If we compute g(f(x, y)) with x and y be two variables, we want to be able to compute the partial derivatives dg/dx, dg/dy, d2g/dx2 d2g/dxdy d2g/dy2. This does make sense since we combined the two functions, and it does make sense despite g is a one argument function only. In order to do this, we simply set up x as an identity function of an implicit free parameter p0 and y as an identity function of a different implicit free parameter p1 and compute everything directly. In order to be able to combine everything, however, both x and y must be built with the appropriate dimensions, so they will both be declared to handle two free parameters, but x will depend only on parameter 0 while y will depend on parameter 1. Here is how we do this (note that DerivativeStructure.getPartialDerivative is a variable arguments method which take as arguments the derivation order with respect to all free parameters, i.e. the first argument is derivation order with respect to free parameter 0 and the second argument is derivation order with respect to free parameter 1):\n",
      "4.7 Differentiation - part 6 int params = 2; int order = 2; double xRealValue = 2.5; double yRealValue = -1.3; DerivativeStructure x = new DerivativeStructure(params, order, 0, xRealValue); DerivativeStructure y = new DerivativeStructure(params, order, 1, yRealValue); DerivativeStructure f = DerivativeStructure.hypot(x, y); DerivativeStructure g = f.log(); System.out.println(\"g = \" + g.getValue(); System.out.println(\"dg/dx = \" + g.getPartialDerivative(1, 0); System.out.println(\"dg/dy = \" + g.getPartialDerivative(0, 1); System.out.println(\"d2g/dx2 = \" + g.getPartialDerivative(2, 0); System.out.println(\"d2g/dxdy = \" + g.getPartialDerivative(1, 1); System.out.println(\"d2g/dy2 = \" + g.getPartialDerivative(0, 2); There are several ways a user can create an implementation of the UnivariateDifferentiableFunction interface. The first method is to simply write it directly using the appropriate methods from DerivativeStructure to compute addition, subtraction, sine, cosine... This is often quite straigthforward and there is no need to remember the rules for differentiation: the user code only represent the function itself, the differentials will be computed automatically under the hood. The second method is to write a classical UnivariateFunction and to pass it to an existing implementation of the UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator interface to retrieve a differentiated version of the same function. The first method is more suited to small functions for which user already control all the underlying code. The second method is more suited to either large functions that would be cumbersome to write using the DerivativeStructure API, or functions for which user does not have control to the full underlying code (for example functions that call external libraries).\n",
      "4.7 Differentiation - part 7 Apache Commons Math provides one implementation of the UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator interface: FiniteDifferencesDifferentiator . This class creates a wrapper that will call the user-provided function on a grid sample and will use finite differences to compute the derivatives. It takes care of boundaries if the variable is not defined on the whole real line. It is possible to use more points than strictly required by the derivation order (for example one can specify an 8-points scheme to compute first derivative only). However, one must be aware that tuning the parameters for finite differences is highly problem-dependent. Choosing the wrong step size or the wrong number of sampling points can lead to huge errors. Finite differences are also not well suited to compute high order derivatives. Another implementation of the UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator interface is under development in the related project Apache Commons Nabla. This implementation uses automatic code analysis and generation at binary level. However, at time of writing (end 2012), this project is not yet suitable for production use.\n",
      "7.2 Complex Numbers Complex provides a complex number type that forms the basis for the complex functionality found in commons-math. Complex functions and arithmetic operations are implemented in commons-math by applying standard computational formulas and following the rules for java.lang.Double arithmetic in handling infinite and NaN values. No attempt is made to comply with ANSII/IEC C99x Annex G or any other standard for Complex arithmetic. See the class and method javadocs for the Complex and ComplexUtils classes for details on computing formulas. To create a complex number, simply call the constructor passing in two floating-point arguments, the first being the real part of the complex number and the second being the imaginary part: Complex c = new Complex(1.0, 3.0); // 1 + 3i Complex numbers may also be created from polar representations using the ComplexUtils.polar2Complex method in ComplexUtils . The Complex class provides basic unary and binary complex number operations. These operations provide the means to add, subtract, multiply and divide complex numbers along with other complex number functions similar to the real number functions found in java.math.BigDecimal: Complex lhs = new Complex(1.0, 3.0); Complex rhs = new Complex(2.0, 5.0); Complex answer = lhs.add(rhs); // add two complex numbers answer = lhs.subtract(rhs); // subtract two complex numbers answer = lhs.abs(); // absolute value answer = lhs.conjugate(rhs); // complex conjugate\n",
      "7.3 Complex Transcendental Functions Complex also provides implementations of serveral transcendental functions involving complex number arguments. Prior to version 1.2, these functions were provided by ComplexUtils in a way similar to the real number functions found in java.lang.Math, but this has been deprecated. These operations provide the means to compute the log, sine, tangent, and other complex values : Complex first = new Complex(1.0, 3.0); Complex second = new Complex(2.0, 5.0); Complex answer = first.log(); // natural logarithm. answer = first.cos(); // cosine answer = first.pow(second); // first raised to the power of second\n",
      "7.4 Complex Formatting and Parsing Complex instances can be converted to and from strings using the ComplexFormat class. ComplexFormat is a java.text.Format extension and, as such, is used like other formatting objects (e.g. java.text.SimpleDateFormat): ComplexFormat format = new ComplexFormat(); // default format Complex c = new Complex(1.1111, 2.2222); String s = format.format(c); // s contains \"1.11 + 2.22i\" To customize the formatting output, one or two java.text.NumberFormat instances can be used to construct a ComplexFormat . These number formats control the formatting of the real and imaginary values of the complex number: NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getInstance(); nf.setMinimumFractionDigits(3); nf.setMaximumFractionDigits(3); // create complex format with custom number format // when one number format is used, both real and // imaginary parts are formatted the same ComplexFormat cf = new ComplexFormat(nf); Complex c = new Complex(1.11, 2.2222); String s = format.format(c); // s contains \"1.110 + 2.222i\" NumberFormat nf2 = NumberFormat.getInstance(); nf.setMinimumFractionDigits(1); nf.setMaximumFractionDigits(1); // create complex format with custom number formats cf = new ComplexFormat(nf, nf2); s = format.format(c); // s contains \"1.110 + 2.2i\" Another formatting customization provided by ComplexFormat is the text used for the imaginary designation. By default, the imaginary notation is \"i\" but, it can be manipulated using the setImaginaryCharacter method. Formatting inverse operation, parsing, can also be performed by ComplexFormat . Parse a complex number from a string, simply call the ComplexFormat.parse method: ComplexFormat cf = new ComplexFormat(); Complex c = cf.parse(\"1.110 + 2.222i\");\n",
      "8.2 Distribution Framework The distribution framework provides the means to compute probability density function (PDF) probabilities and cumulative distribution function (CDF) probabilities for common probability distributions. Along with the direct computation of PDF and CDF probabilities, the framework also allows for the computation of inverse PDF and inverse CDF values. Using a distribution object, PDF and CDF probabilities are easily computed using the AbstractIntegerDistribution.cumulativeProbability methods. For a distribution X, and a domain value, x, AbstractIntegerDistribution.cumulativeProbability computes P(X <= x) (i.e. the lower tail probability of X). TDistribution t = new TDistribution(29); double lowerTail = t.cumulativeProbability(-2.656); // P(T <= -2.656) double upperTail = 1.0 - t.cumulativeProbability(2.75); // P(T >= 2.75) The inverse PDF and CDF values are just as easily computed using the AbstractIntegerDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability methods. For a distribution X, and a probability, p, AbstractIntegerDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability computes the domain value x, such that: P(X <= x) = p, for continuous distributions P(X <= x) <= p, for discrete distributions\n",
      "8.3 User Defined Distributions Since there are numerous distributions and Commons-Math only directly supports a handful, it may be necessary to extend the distribution framework to satisfy individual needs. It is recommended that the Distribution, ContinuousDistribution, DiscreteDistribution, and IntegerDistribution interfaces serve as base types for any extension. These serve as the basis for all the distributions directly supported by Commons-Math and using those interfaces for implementation purposes will ensure any extension is compatible with the remainder of Commons-Math. To aid in implementing a distribution extension, the AbstractDistribution, AbstractContinuousDistribution, and AbstractIntegerDistribution provide implementation building blocks and offer basic distribution functionality. By extending these abstract classes directly, much of the repetitive distribution implementation is already developed and should save time and effort in developing user-defined distributions.\n",
      "16.3 Hierarchies The exceptions defined by Commons Math follow the Java standard hierarchies: IllegalArgumentException: A MathIllegalArgumentException is thrown when some input parameter fails a precondition check. IllegalStateException: A MathIllegalStateException is thrown when some inconsistency has been detected. ArithmeticException: A MathArithmeticException is thrown when conditions such as \"division by zero\" or \"overflow\" are encountered. UnsupportedOperationException: A MathUnsupportedOperationException indicates that a feature is missing or does not make sense in the given context. In all of the above exception hierarchies, several subclasses can exist, each conveying a specific underlying cause of the problem.\n",
      "16.4 Features Localization The detailed error messages (i.e. the string returned by the ExceptionContext.getLocalizedMessage method) can be localized. However, besides the American/English default, French is the only language for which a translation resource is available. Exception \"context\" Every exception generated by Commons Math implements the ExceptionContextProvider interface. A call to the ExceptionContextProvider.getContext method will return the ExceptionContext instance stored in the exception, which the user can further customize by adding messages and/or any object.\n",
      "15.2 Kalman Filter KalmanFilter provides a discrete-time filter to estimate a stochastic linear process. A Kalman filter is initialized with a ProcessModel and a MeasurementModel , which contain the corresponding transformation and noise covariance matrices. The parameter names used in the respective models correspond to the following names commonly used in the mathematical literature: A - state transition matrix B - control input matrix H - measurement matrix Q - process noise covariance matrix R - measurement noise covariance matrix P - error covariance matrix Initialization The following code will create a Kalman filter using the provided DefaultMeasurementModel and DefaultProcessModel classes. To support dynamically changing process and measurement noises, simply implement your own models. // A = [ 1 ] RealMatrix A = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { 1d }); // no control input RealMatrix B = null; // H = [ 1 ] RealMatrix H = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { 1d }); // Q = [ 0 ] RealMatrix Q = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { 0 }); // R = [ 0 ] RealMatrix R = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { 0 }); ProcessModel pm = new DefaultProcessModel(A, B, Q, new ArrayRealVector(new double[] { 0 }), null); MeasurementModel mm = new DefaultMeasurementModel(H, R); KalmanFilter filter = new KalmanFilter(pm, mm); Iteration The following code illustrates how to perform the predict/correct cycle: for (;;) { // predict the state estimate one time-step ahead // optionally provide some control input filter.predict(); // obtain measurement vector z RealVector z = getMeasurement(); // correct the state estimate with the latest measurement filter.correct(z); double[] stateEstimate = filter.getStateEstimation(); // do something with it } Constant Voltage Example The following example creates a Kalman filter for a static process: a system with a constant voltage as internal state. We observe this process with an artificially imposed measurement noise of 0.1V and assume an internal process noise of 1e-5V. double constantVoltage = 10d; double measurementNoise = 0.1d; double processNoise = 1e-5d; // A = [ 1 ] RealMatrix A = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { 1d }); // B = null RealMatrix B = null; // H = [ 1 ] RealMatrix H = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { 1d }); // x = [ 10 ] RealVector x = new ArrayRealVector(new double[] { constantVoltage }); // Q = [ 1e-5 ] RealMatrix Q = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { processNoise }); // P = [ 1 ] RealMatrix P0 = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { 1d }); // R = [ 0.1 ] RealMatrix R = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[] { measurementNoise }); ProcessModel pm = new DefaultProcessModel(A, B, Q, x, P0); MeasurementModel mm = new DefaultMeasurementModel(H, R); KalmanFilter filter = new KalmanFilter(pm, mm); // process and measurement noise vectors RealVector pNoise = new ArrayRealVector(1); RealVector mNoise = new ArrayRealVector(1); RandomGenerator rand = new JDKRandomGenerator(); // iterate 60 steps for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) { filter.predict(); // simulate the process pNoise.setEntry(0, processNoise * rand.nextGaussian()); // x = A * x + p_noise x = A.operate(x).add(pNoise); // simulate the measurement mNoise.setEntry(0, measurementNoise * rand.nextGaussian()); // z = H * x + m_noise RealVector z = H.operate(x).add(mNoise); filter.correct(z); double voltage = filter.getStateEstimation()[0]; }\n",
      "9.2 Fraction Numbers Fraction and BigFraction provide fraction number type that forms the basis for the fraction functionality found in Commons-Math. The former one can be used for fractions whose numerators and denominators are small enough to fit in an int (taking care of intermediate values) while the second class should be used when there is a risk the numerator and denominator grow very large. A fraction number, can be built from two integer arguments representing numerator and denominator or from a double which will be approximated: Fraction f = new Fraction(1, 3); // 1 / 3 Fraction g = new Fraction(0.25); // 1 / 4 Of special note with fraction construction, when a fraction is created it is always reduced to lowest terms. The Fraction class provides many unary and binary fraction operations. These operations provide the means to add, subtract, multiple and, divide fractions along with other functions similar to the real number functions found in java.math.BigDecimal: Fraction lhs = new Fraction(1, 3); Fraction rhs = new Fraction(2, 5); Fraction answer = lhs.add(rhs); // add two fractions answer = lhs.subtract(rhs); // subtract two fractions answer = lhs.abs(); // absolute value answer = lhs.reciprocal(); // reciprocal of lhs Like fraction construction, for each of the fraction functions, the resulting fraction is reduced to lowest terms.\n",

These number formats control the formatting of the numerator and denominator of the fraction: NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.FRANCE); // create fraction format with custom number format // when one number format is used, both numerator and // denominator are formatted the same FractionFormat format = new FractionFormat(nf); Fraction f = new Fraction(2000, 3333); String s = format.format(c); // s contains \"2.000 / 3.333\" NumberFormat nf2 = NumberFormat.getInstance(Locale.US); // create fraction format with custom number formats format = new FractionFormat(nf, nf2); s = format.format(f); // s contains \"2.000 / 3,333\" Formatting's inverse operation, parsing, can also be performed by FractionFormat . To parse a fraction from a string, simply call the FractionFormat.parse method: FractionFormat ff = new FractionFormat(); Fraction f = ff.parse(\"-10 / 21\");\n",
      "14.2 GA Framework GeneticAlgorithm provides an execution framework for Genetic Algorithms (GA). Populations, consisting of Chromosomes are evolved by the GeneticAlgorithm until a StoppingCondition is reached. Evolution is determined by SelectionPolicy , MutationPolicy and Fitness . The GA itself is implemented by the GeneticAlgorithm.evolve method of the GeneticAlgorithm class, which looks like this: public Population evolve(Population initial, StoppingCondition condition) { Population current = initial; while (!condition.isSatisfied(current)) { current = nextGeneration(current); } return current; } The GeneticAlgorithm.nextGeneration method implements the following algorithm: Get nextGeneration population to fill from current generation, using its nextGeneration method Loop until new generation is filled: Apply configured SelectionPolicy to select a pair of parents from current With probability = GeneticAlgorithm.getCrossoverRate() , apply configured CrossoverPolicy to parents With probability = GeneticAlgorithm.getMutationRate() , apply configured MutationPolicy to each of the offspring Add offspring individually to nextGeneration, space permitting Return nextGeneration\n",

The algorithm starts with an initial population of Chromosomes. and executes until the specified StoppingCondition is reached. In the example above, a FixedGenerationCount stopping condition is used, which means the algorithm proceeds through a fixed number of generations.\n",

All classical set operations are available for intervals sets: union, intersection, symmetric difference (exclusive or), difference, complement, as well as region predicates (point inside/outside/on boundary, emptiness, other region contained). It is also possible to compute geometrical properties like size, barycenter or boundary size. Intervals sets can be built by constructive geometry (union, intersection ...) or from a boundary representation. PolygonsSet represent two dimensional regions. All classical set operations are available for polygons sets: union, intersection, symmetric difference (exclusive or), difference, complement, as well as region predicates (point inside/outside/on boundary, emptiness, other region contained).

It is also possible to compute geometrical properties like size, barycenter or boundary size and to extract the vertices. Polyhedrons sets can be built by constructive geometry (union, intersection ...) or from a boundary representation. Vector3D provides a simple vector type. One important feature is that instances of this class are guaranteed to be immutable, this greatly simplifies modelling dynamical systems with changing states: once a vector has been computed, a reference to it is known to preserve its state as long as the reference itself is preserved. Numerous constructors are available to create vectors. In addition to the straightforward cartesian coordinates constructor, a constructor using azimuthal coordinates can build normalized vectors and linear constructors from one, two, three or four base vectors are also available. Constants have been defined for the most commons vectors (plus and minus canonical axes, null vector, and special vectors with infinite or NaN coordinates).\n",
      "11.2 Euclidean spaces - part 3 The generic vectorial space operations are available including dot product, normalization, orthogonal vector finding and angular separation computation which have a specific meaning in 3D. The 3D geometry specific cross product is of course also implemented. Vector3DFormat is a specialized format for formatting output or parsing input with text representation of 3D vectors. Rotation represents 3D rotations. Rotation instances are also immutable objects, as Vector3D instances. Rotations can be represented by several different mathematical entities (matrices, axe and angle, Cardan or Euler angles, quaternions). This class presents a higher level abstraction, more user-oriented and hiding implementation details. Well, for the curious, we use quaternions for the internal representation. The user can build a rotation from any of these representations, and any of these representations can be retrieved from a Rotation instance (see the various constructors and getters). In addition, a rotation can also be built implicitely from a set of vectors and their image.\n",
      "11.2 Euclidean spaces - part 6 These examples show that a rotation means what the user wants it to mean, so this class does not push the user towards one specific definition and hence does not provide methods like projectVectorIntoDestinationFrame or computeTransformedDirection. It provides simpler and more generic methods: Rotation.applyTo(Vector3D) and Rotation.applyInverseTo(Vector3D) . Since a rotation is basically a vectorial operator, several rotations can be composed together and the composite operation r = r1 o r2 (which means that for each vector u, r(u) = r1(r2(u))) is also a rotation. Hence we can consider that in addition to vectors, a rotation can be applied to other rotations as well (or to itself). With our previous notations, we would say we can apply r1 to r2 and the result we get is r = r1 o r2. For this purpose, the class provides the methods: Rotation.applyTo(Rotation) and Rotation.applyInverseTo(Rotation) .\n",

Each node in a BSP tree represents a convex region which is partitioned in two convex sub-regions at each side of a cut hyperplane. The root tree contains the complete space. The main use of such partitions is to use a boolean attribute to define an inside/outside property, hence representing arbitrary polytopes (line segments in 1D, polygons in 2D and polyhedrons in 3D) and to operate on them. Another example would be to represent Voronoi tesselations, the attribute of each cell holding the defining point of the cell.\n",

The following basic matrix operations are supported: Matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication Scalar addition and multiplication transpose Norm and Trace Operation on a vector Example: // Create a real matrix with two rows and three columns double[][] matrixData = { {1d,2d,3d}, {2d,5d,3d}}; RealMatrix m = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(matrixData); // One more with three rows, two columns double[][] matrixData2 = { {1d,2d}, {2d,5d}, {1d, 7d}}; RealMatrix n = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(matrixData2); // Note: The constructor copies the input double[][] array. // Now multiply m by n RealMatrix p = m.multiply(n); System.out.println(p.getRowDimension()); // 2 System.out.println(p.getColumnDimension()); // 2 // Invert p, using LU decomposition RealMatrix pInverse = new LUDecompositionImpl(p).getSolver().getInverse(); The three main implementations of the interface are Array2DRowRealMatrix and BlockRealMatrix for dense matrices (the second one being more suited to dimensions above 50 or 100) and SparseRealMatrix for sparse matrices.\n",

A RealMatrix instance is used to represent the coefficient matrix of the system. Solving the system is a two phases process: first the coefficient matrix is decomposed in some way and then a solver built from the decomposition solves the system. This allows to compute the decomposition and build the solver only once if several systems have to be solved with the same coefficient matrix. For example, to solve the linear system 2x + 3y - 2z = 1 -x + 7y + 6x = -2 4x - 3y - 5z = 1 RealMatrix coefficients = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(new double[][] { { 2, 3, -2 }, { -1, 7, 6 }, { 4, -3, -5 } }, false); DecompositionSolver solver = new LUDecompositionImpl(coefficients).getSolver(); RealVector DecompositionSolver.solve(RealVector) RealVector constants = new ArrayRealVector(new double[] { 1, -2, 1 }, false); RealVector solution = solver.solve(constants); solution solution.RealVector.getEntry(0) solution.RealVector.getEntry(1) solution.RealVector.getEntry(2)\n",
      "3.4 Solving linear systems - part 2 Each type of decomposition has its specific semantics and constraints on the coefficient matrix as shown in the following table. For algorithms that solve AX=B in least squares sense the value returned for X is such that the residual AX-B has minimal norm. If an exact solution exist (i.e. if for some X the residual AX-B is exactly 0), then this exact solution is also the solution in least square sense. This implies that algorithms suited for least squares problems can also be used to solve exact problems, but the reverse is not true. Decomposition algorithms Name coefficients matrix problem type LU square exact solution only Cholesky symmetric positive definite exact solution only QR any least squares solution eigen decomposition square exact solution only SVD any least squares solution It is possible to use a simple array of double instead of a RealVector . In this case, the solution will be provided also as an array of double.\n",
      "3.4 Solving linear systems - part 3 It is possible to solve multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix in one method call. To do this, create a matrix whose column vectors correspond to the constant vectors for the systems to be solved and use DecompositionSolver.solve(RealMatrix), which returns a matrix with column vectors representing the solutions.\n",
      "3.5 Eigenvalues/eigenvectors and singular values/singular vectors Decomposition algorithms may be used for themselves and not only for linear system solving. This is of prime interest with eigen decomposition and singular value decomposition. The getEigenvalue(), getEigenvalues(), getEigenVector(), EigenDecomposition.getV() , EigenDecomposition.getD() and EigenDecomposition.getVT() methods of the EigenDecomposition interface support solving eigenproblems of the form AX = lambda X where lambda is a real scalar. The SingularValueDecomposition.getSingularValues() , SingularValueDecomposition.getU() , SingularValueDecomposition.getS() and SingularValueDecomposition.getV() methods of the SingularValueDecomposition interface allow to solve singular values problems of the form AXi = lambda Yi where lambda is a real scalar, and where the Xi and Yi vectors form orthogonal bases of their respective vector spaces (which may have different dimensions).\n",
      "3.6 Non-real fields (complex, fractions ...) In addition to the real field, matrices and vectors using non-real field elements can be used. The fields already supported by the library are: Complex Fraction BigFraction BigReal\n",

      "Create a Form to fill out Description An XMPP entity may need to gather data from another XMPP entity. Therefore, the data-gathering entity will need to create a new Form, specify the fields that will conform the Form and finally send the Form to the data-providing entity. Usage In order to create a Form to fill out use the Form 's constructor passing the constant Form.TYPE_FORM as the parameter. The next step is to create the form fields and add them to the form. In order to create and customize a FormField use the FormField 's constructor specifying the variable name of the field as the parameter. Then use FormField.setType(String type) to set the field's type (e.g. FormField.TYPE_HIDDEN, FormField.TYPE_TEXT_SINGLE). Once we have the Form instance and the FormFields the last step is to send Form.addField(FormField field) for each field that we want to add to the form. Once the form to fill out is finished we will want to send it in a message. Send Form.getDataFormToSend() to the form and add the answer as an extension to the message to send. Examples In this example we can see how to create and send a form to fill out: // Create a new form to gather data Form formToSend = new Form(Form.TYPE_FORM); formToSend.setInstructions( \"Fill out this form to report your case.\\nThe case will be created automatically.\"); formToSend.setTitle(\"Case configurations\"); // Add a hidden variable to the form FormField field = new FormField(\"hidden_var\"); field.setType(FormField.TYPE_HIDDEN); field.addValue(\"Some value for the hidden variable\"); formToSend.addField(field); // Add a fixed variable to the form field = new FormField(); field.addValue(\"Section 1: Case description\"); formToSend.addField(field); // Add a text-single variable to the form field = new FormField(\"name\"); field.setLabel(\"Enter a name for the case\"); field.setType(FormField.TYPE_TEXT_SINGLE); formToSend.addField(field); // Add a text-multi variable to the form field = new FormField(\"description\"); field.setLabel(\"Enter a description\"); field.setType(FormField.TYPE_TEXT_MULTI); formToSend.addField(field); // Create a chat with \"user2@host.com\" Chat chat = conn1.createChat(\"user2@host.com\" ); Message msg = chat.createMessage(); msg.setBody(\"To enter a case please fill out this form and send it back to me\"); // Add the form to fill out to the message to send msg.addExtension(formToSend.getDataFormToSend()); // Send the message with the form to fill out chat.sendMessage(msg);\n",
      "Answer a Form Description Under many situations an XMPP entity could receive a form to fill out. For example, some hosts may require to fill out a form in order to register new users. Smack lets the data-providing entity to complete the form in an easy way and send it back to the data-gathering entity. Usage The form to fill out contains useful information that could be used for rendering the form. But it cannot be used to actually complete it. Instead it's necessary to create a new form based on the original form whose purpose is to hold all the answers. In order to create a new Form to complete based on the original Form just send Form.createAnswerForm() to the original Form . Once you have a valid form that could be actually completed all you have to do is send Form.setAnswer(String variable, String value) to the form where variable is the variable of the FormField that you want to answer and value is the String representation of the answer. If the answer consist of several values you could then use Form.setAnswer(String variable, List values) where values is a List of Strings.\n",
      "Answer a Form - part 2 Once the form has been completed we will want to send it back in a message. Send Form.getDataFormToSend() to the form and add the answer as an extension to the message to send back. Examples In this example we can see how to retrieve a form to fill out, complete the form and send it back: // Get the message with the form to fill out Message msg2 = chat2.nextMessage(); // Retrieve the form to fill out from the message Form formToRespond = Form.getFormFrom(msg2); // Obtain the form to send with the replies Form completedForm = formToRespond.createAnswerForm(); // Add the answers to the form completedForm.setAnswer(\"name\", \"Credit card number invalid\"); completedForm.setAnswer( \"description\", \"The ATM says that my credit card number is invalid. What's going on?\"); msg2 = chat2.createMessage(); msg2.setBody(\"To enter a case please fill out this form and send it back to me\"); // Add the completed form to the message to send back msg2.addExtension(completedForm.getDataFormToSend()); // Send the message with the completed form chat2.sendMessage(msg2);\n",
      "Send a file to another user Description A user may wish to send a file to another user. The other user has the option of acception, rejecting, or ignoring the users request. Smack provides a simple interface in order to enable the user to easily send a file. Usage In order to send a file you must first construct an instance of the FileTransferManager class. This class has one constructor with one parameter which is your Connection. In order to instantiate the manager you should call new FileTransferManager.FileTransferManager(connection) Once you have your FileTransferManager you will need to create an outgoing file transfer to send a file. The method to use on the FileTransferManager is the FileTransferManager.createOutgoingFileTransfer(userID) method. The userID you provide to this method is the fully-qualified jabber ID of the user you wish to send the file to. A fully-qualified jabber ID consists of a node, a domain, and a resource, the user must be connected to the resource in order to be able to recieve the file transfer.\n",
      "Send a file to another user - part 2 Now that you have your OutgoingFileTransfer instance you will want to send the file. The method to send a file is OutgoingFileTransfer.sendFile(file, description) . The file you provide to this method should be a readable file on the local file system, and the description is a short description of the file to help the user decide whether or not they would like to recieve the file. For information on monitoring the progress of a file transfer see the monitoring progress section of this document. Other means to send a file are also provided as part of the OutgoingFileTransfer . Please consult the Javadoc for more information. Examples In this example we can see how to send a file: // Create the file transfer manager FileTransferManager manager = new FileTransferManager(connection); // Create the outgoing file transfer OutgoingFileTransfer transfer = manager.createOutgoingFileTransfer(\"romeo@montague.net\"); // Send the file transfer.sendFile(new File(\"shakespeare_complete_works.txt\"), \"You won't believe this!\");\n",
      "Recieving a file from another user Description The user may wish to recieve files from another user. The process of recieving a file is event driven, new file transfer requests are recieved from other users via a listener registered with the file transfer manager. Usage In order to recieve a file you must first construct an instance of the FileTransferManager class. This class has one constructor with one parameter which is your Connection. In order to instantiate the manager you should call new FileTransferManager.FileTransferManager(connection) Once you have your FileTransferManager you will need to register a listener with it. The FileTransferListner interface has one method, FileTransferListener.fileTransferRequest(request) . When a request is recieved through this method, you can either accept or reject the request. To help you make your decision there are several methods in the FileTransferRequest class that return information about the transfer request.\n",
      "Recieving a file from another user - part 2 To accept the file transfer, call the FileTransferRequest.accept() , this method will create an IncomingFileTransfer . After you have the file transfer you may start to transfer the file by calling the IncomingFileTransfer.recieveFile(file) method. The file provided to this method will be where the data from thefile transfer is saved. Finally, to reject the file transfer the only method you need to call is FileTransferRequest.reject() on the IncomingFileTransfer . For information on monitoring the progress of a file transfer see the monitoring progress section of this document. Other means to recieve a file are also provided as part of the IncomingFileTransfer . Please consult the Javadoc for more information. Examples In this example we can see how to approve or reject a file transfer request: // Create the file transfer manager final FileTransferManager manager = new FileTransferManager(connection); // Create the listener manager.addFileTransferListener(new FileTransferListener() { public void fileTransferRequest(FileTransferRequest request) { // Check to see if the request should be accepted if(shouldAccept(request)) { // Accept it IncomingFileTransfer transfer = request.accept(); transfer.recieveFile(new File(\"shakespeare_complete_works.txt\")); } else { // Reject it request.reject(); } } });\n",
      "Monitoring the progress of a file transfer Description While a file transfer is in progress you may wish to monitor the progress of a file transfer. Usage Both the IncomingFileTransfer and the OutgoingFileTransfer extend the FileTransfer class which provides several methods to monitor how a file transfer is progressing: FileTransfer.getStatus() - The file transfer can be in several states, negotiating, rejected, canceled, in progress, error, and complete. This method will return which state the file transfer is currently in. FileTransfer.getProgress() - if the status of the file transfer is in progress this method will return a number between 0 and 1, 0 being the transfer has not yet started and 1 being the transfer is complete. It may also return a -1 if the transfer is not in progress. FileTransfer.isDone() - Similar to getProgress() except it returns a boolean. If the state is rejected, canceled, error, or complete then true will be returned and false otherwise. FileTransfer.getError() - If there is an error during the file transfer this method will return the type of error that occured. Examples In this example we can see how to monitor a file transfer: while(!transfer.isDone()) { if(transfer.getStatus().equals(Status.ERROR)) { System.out.println(\"ERROR!!! \" + transfer.getError()); } else { System.out.println(transfer.getStatus()); System.out.println(transfer.getProgress()); } sleep(1000); }\n",
      "Processing Incoming Packets Smack provides a flexible framework for processing incoming packets using two constructs: org.jivesoftware.smack.PacketCollector -- a class that lets you synchronously wait for new packets. org.jivesoftware.smack.PacketListener -- an interface for asynchronously notifying you of incoming packets. A packet listener is used for event style programming, while a packet collector has a result queue of packets that you can do polling and blocking operations on. So, a packet listener is useful when you want to take some action whenever a packet happens to come in, while a packet collector is useful when you want to wait for a specific packet to arrive. Packet collectors and listeners can be created using an Connection instance. The org.jivesoftware.smack.filter.PacketFilter interface determines which specific packets will be delivered to a PacketCollector or PacketListener . Many pre-defined filters can be found in the org.jivesoftware.smack.filter package. The following code snippet demonstrates registering both a packet collector and a packet listener: // Create a packet filter to listen for new messages from a particular // user. We use an AndFilter to combine two other filters. PacketFilter filter = new AndFilter(new PacketTypeFilter(Message.class), new FromContainsFilter(\"mary@jivesoftware.com\")); // Assume we've created a Connection name \"connection\". // First, register a packet collector using the filter we created. PacketCollector myCollector = connection.createPacketCollector(filter); // Normally, you'd do something with the collector, like wait for new packets. // Next, create a packet listener. We use an anonymous inner class for brevity. PacketListener myListener = new PacketListener() { public void processPacket(Packet packet) { // Do something with the incoming packet here. } }; // Register the listener. connection.addPacketListener(myListener, filter);\n",
      "Provider Architecture: Packet Extensions and Custom IQ's The Smack provider architecture is a system for plugging in custom XML parsing of packet extensions and IQ packets. The standard Smack Extensions are built using the provider architecture. Two types of providers exist: IQProvider -- parses IQ requests into Java objects. PacketExtension -- parses XML sub-documents attached to packets into PacketExtension instances.\n",
      "Node creation and configuration Description Allowed users may create and configure pubsub nodes. There are two types of nodes that can be created, leaf nodes and collection nodes. Leaf Nodes - contains only messages Collection Nodes - contains only nodes (both Leaf and Collection are allowed), but no messages The current version of this API only supports Leaf Nodes. There are many configuration options available for nodes, but the two main options are whether the node is persistent or not and whether it will deliver payload or not. Usage In order to create a node you will need to first create an instance of PubSubManager . There are several options for node creation which range from creating an instant node, default configuration, or a fully configured node. Examples Create an instant node: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Create the node LeafNode leaf = mgr.createNode(); Create a node with default configuration and then configure it: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Create the node LeafNode leaf = mgr.createNode(\"testNode\"); ConfigureForm form = new ConfigureForm(FormType.submit); form.setAccessModel(AccessModel.open); form.setDeliverPayloads(false); form.setNotifyRetract(true); form.setPersistentItems(true); form.setPublishModel(PublishModel.open); leaf.sendConfigurationForm(form); Create and configure a node: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Create the node ConfigureForm form = new ConfigureForm(FormType.submit); form.setAccessModel(AccessModel.open); form.setDeliverPayloads(false); form.setNotifyRetract(true); form.setPersistentItems(true); form.setPublishModel(PublishModel.open); LeafNode leaf = mgr.createNode(\"testNode\", form);\n",
      "Publishing to a node Description This section deals with the LeafNode.publish portion of pubsub. Usage of a node typically involves either sending or receiving data, referred to as items. Depending on the context of the nodes usage, the item being sent to it can have different properties. It can contain application data known as payload, or the publisher may choose to supply meaningful unique id's. Determination of an items acceptable properties is defined by a combination of node configuration and its purpose. Usage To publish to a node, you will have to either create or retrieve an existing node and then create and send items to that node. The ability for any given person to publish to the node will be dependent on its configuration. Examples In this example we publish an item to a node that does not take payload: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get the node LeafNode node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); // Publish an Item, let service set the id node.send(new Item()); // Publish an Item with the specified id node.send(new Item(\"123abc\")); In this example we publish an item to a node that does take payload: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get the node LeafNode node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); // Publish an Item with payload node.send(new PayloadItem(\"test\" + System.currentTimeMillis(), new SimplePayload(\"book\", \"pubsub:test:book\", \"Two Towers\")));\n",
      "Receiving pubsub messages Description This section deals with the Node.subscribe portion of pubsub. As mentioned in the last section, usage of a node typically involves either sending or receiving items. Subscribers are interested in being notified when items are published to the pubsub node. These items may or may not have application specific data (payload), as that is dependent on the context in which the node is being used. Usage To get messages asynchronously when items are published to a node, you will have to Get a node. Create and register a listener. Subscribe to the node. Please note that you should register the listener before subscribing so that all messages sent after subscribing are received. If done in the reverse order, messages that are sent after subscribing but before registering a listener may not be processed as expected.\n",
      "Retrieving persisted pubsub messages Description When persistent nodes are used, the subscription and registration methods described in the last section will not enable the retrieval of items that already exist in the node. This section deals with the specific methods for retrieving these items. There are several means of retrieving existing items. You can retrieve all items at once, the last N items, or the items specified by a collection of id's. Please note that the service may, according to the pubsub specification, reply with a list of items that contains only the item id's (no payload) to save on bandwidth. This will not occur when the id's are specified since this is the means of guaranteeing retrieval of payload. Usage To synchronously retrieve existing items from a persistent node, you will have to get an instance of a LeafNode and call one of the retrieve methods. Examples In this example we can see how to retrieve the existing items from a node: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get the node LeafNode node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); Collection<? extends Item> items = node.getItems(); In this example we can see how to retrieve the last N existing items: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get the node LeafNode node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); List<? extends Item> items = node.getItems(100); In this example we can see how to retrieve the specified existing items: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get the node LeafNode node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); Collection<String> ids = new ArrayList<String>(3); ids.add(\"1\"); ids.add(\"3\"); ids.add(\"4\"); List<? extends Item> items = node.getItems(ids);\n",
      "Discover pubsub information Description A user may want to query a server or node for a variety of pubsub related information. Usage To retrieve information, a user will simply use either the PubSubManager or Node classes depending on what type of information is required. Examples In this example we can see how to get pubsub capabilities: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get the pubsub features that are supported DiscoverInfo supportedFeatures = mgr.getSupportedFeatures(); In this example we can see how to get pubsub subscriptions for all nodes: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get all the subscriptions in the pubsub service List<Subscription> subscriptions = mgr.getSubscriptions(); In this example we can see how to get all affiliations for the users bare JID on the pubsub service: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); // Get the affiliations for the users bare JID List<Affiliation> affiliations = mgr.getAffiliations(); In this example we can see how to get information about the node: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); Node node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); // Get the node information DiscoverInfo nodeInfo = node.discoverInfo(); In this example we can see how to discover the node items: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); Node node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); // Discover the node items DiscoverItems nodeItems = node.discoverItems(); In this example we can see how to get node subscriptions: // Create a pubsub manager using an existing Connection PubSubManager mgr = new PubSubManager(con); Node node = mgr.getNode(\"testNode\"); // Discover the node subscriptions List<Subscription> subscriptions = node.getSubscriptions();\n",
      "Debugging with Smack Smack includes two built-in debugging consoles that will let you track all XML traffic between the client and server. A lite debugger which is part of the smack.jar and an enhanced debugger contained in smackx-debug.jar. Debugging mode can be enabled in two different ways: Add the following line of code before creating new connections: Connection.DEBUG_ENABLED = true; Set the Java system property smack.debugEnabled to true. The system property can be set on the command line such as: java -Dsmack.debugEnabled=true SomeApp If you wish to explicitly disable debug mode in your application, including using the command-line parameter, add the following line to your application before opening new connections: Connection.DEBUG_ENABLED = false; Smack uses the following logic to decide the debugger console to use: It will first try use the debugger class specified in the Java system property smack.debuggerClass. If you need to develop your own debugger, implement the SmackDebugger interface and then set the system property on the command line such as: java -Dsmack.debuggerClass=my.company.com.MyDebugger SomeApp\n",
      "Manage XMPP entity features Description Any XMPP entity may receive a discovery request and must answer with its associated items or information. Therefore, your Smack client may receive a discovery request that must respond to (i.e., if your client supports XHTML-IM). This extension automatically responds to a discovery request with the information that you previously configured. Usage In order to configure the supported features by your client you should first obtain the ServiceDiscoveryManager associated with your Connection. To get your ServiceDiscoveryManager send ServiceDiscoveryManager.getInstanceFor(connection) to the class ServiceDiscoveryManager where connection is your Connection. Once you have your ServiceDiscoveryManager you will be able to manage the supported features. To register a new feature send ServiceDiscoveryManager.addFeature(feature) to your ServiceDiscoveryManager where feature is a String that represents the supported feature. To remove a supported feature send ServiceDiscoveryManager.removeFeature(feature) to your ServiceDiscoveryManager where feature is a String that represents the feature to remove. Examples In this example we can see how to add and remove supported features: // Obtain the ServiceDiscoveryManager associated with my Connection ServiceDiscoveryManager discoManager = ServiceDiscoveryManager.getInstanceFor(connection); // Register that a new feature is supported by this XMPP entity discoManager.addFeature(namespace1); // Remove the specified feature from the supported features by this XMPP entity discoManager.removeFeature(namespace2);\n",
      "Provide node information Description Your XMPP entity may receive a discovery request for items non-addressable as a JID such as the MUC rooms where you are joined. In order to answer the correct information it is necessary to configure the information providers associated to the items/nodes within the Smack client. Usage In order to configure the associated nodes within the Smack client you will need to create a NodeInformationProvider and register it with the ServiceDiscoveryManager . To get your ServiceDiscoveryManager send ServiceDiscoveryManager.getInstanceFor(connection) to the class ServiceDiscoveryManager where connection is your Connection. Once you have your ServiceDiscoveryManager you will be able to register information providers for the XMPP entity's nodes. To register a new node information provider send ServiceDiscoveryManager.setNodeInformationProvider(String node, NodeInformationProvider listener) to your ServiceDiscoveryManager where node is the item non-addressable as a JID and listener is the NodeInformationProvider to register. To unregister a NodeInformationProvider send ServiceDiscoveryManager.removeNodeInformationProvider(String node) to your ServiceDiscoveryManager where node is the item non-addressable as a JID whose information provider we want to unregister. Examples In this example we can see how to register a NodeInformationProvider with a ServiceDiscoveryManager that will provide information concerning a node named \"http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#rooms\": // Set the NodeInformationProvider that will provide information about the // joined rooms whenever a disco request is received ServiceDiscoveryManager.getInstanceFor(connection).setNodeInformationProvider( \"http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#rooms\", new NodeInformationProvider() { public Iterator getNodeItems() { ArrayList answer = new ArrayList(); Iterator rooms = MultiUserChat.getJoinedRooms(connection); while (rooms.hasNext()) { answer.add(new DiscoverItems.Item((String)rooms.next())); } return answer.iterator(); } });\n",
      "Discover items associated with an XMPP entity Description In order to obtain information about a specific item you have to first discover the items available in an XMPP entity. Usage Once you have your ServiceDiscoveryManager you will be able to discover items associated with an XMPP entity. To discover the items of a given XMPP entity send ServiceDiscoveryManager.discoverItems(entityID) to your ServiceDiscoveryManager where entityID is the ID of the entity. The message ServiceDiscoveryManager.discoverItems(entityID) will answer an instance of DiscoverItems that contains the discovered items. Examples In this example we can see how to discover the items associated with an online catalog service: // Obtain the ServiceDiscoveryManager associated with my Connection ServiceDiscoveryManager discoManager = ServiceDiscoveryManager.getInstanceFor(connection); // Get the items of a given XMPP entity // This example gets the items associated with online catalog service DiscoverItems discoItems = discoManager.discoverItems(\"plays.shakespeare.lit\"); // Get the discovered items of the queried XMPP entity Iterator it = discoItems.getItems(); // Display the items of the remote XMPP entity while (it.hasNext()) { DiscoverItems.Item item = (DiscoverItems.Item) it.next(); System.out.println(item.getEntityID()); System.out.println(item.getNode()); System.out.println(item.getName()); }\n",
      "Discover information about an XMPP entity Description Once you have discovered the entity ID and name of an item, you may want to find out more about the item. The information desired generally is of two kinds: 1) The item's identity and 2) The features offered by the item. This information helps you determine what actions are possible with regard to this item (registration, search, join, etc.) as well as specific feature types of interest, if any (e.g., for the purpose of feature negotiation). Usage Once you have your ServiceDiscoveryManager you will be able to discover information associated with an XMPP entity. To discover the information of a given XMPP entity send ServiceDiscoveryManager.discoverInfo(entityID) to your ServiceDiscoveryManager where entityID is the ID of the entity. The message ServiceDiscoveryManager.discoverInfo(entityID) will answer an instance of DiscoverInfo that contains the discovered information. Examples In this example we can see how to discover the information of a conference room: // Obtain the ServiceDiscoveryManager associated with my Connection ServiceDiscoveryManager discoManager = ServiceDiscoveryManager.getInstanceFor(connection); // Get the information of a given XMPP entity // This example gets the information of a conference room DiscoverInfo discoInfo = discoManager.discoverInfo(\"balconyscene@plays.shakespeare.lit\"); // Get the discovered identities of the remote XMPP entity Iterator it = discoInfo.getIdentities(); // Display the identities of the remote XMPP entity while (it.hasNext()) { DiscoverInfo.Identity identity = (DiscoverInfo.Identity) it.next(); System.out.println(identity.getName()); System.out.println(identity.getType()); System.out.println(identity.getCategory()); } // Check if room is password protected discoInfo.containsFeature(\"muc_passwordprotected\");\n",
      "Publish publicly available items Description Publish your entity items to some kind of persistent storage. This enables other entities to query that entity using the disco#items namespace and receive a result even when the entity being queried is not online (or available). Usage Once you have your ServiceDiscoveryManager you will be able to publish items to some kind of persistent storage. To publish the items of a given XMPP entity you have to first create an instance of DiscoverItems and configure it with the items to publish. Then you will have to send ServiceDiscoveryManager.publishItems(String entityID, DiscoverItems discoverItems) to your ServiceDiscoveryManager where entityID is the address of the XMPP entity that will persist the items and discoverItems contains the items to publish. Examples In this example we can see how to publish new items: // Obtain the ServiceDiscoveryManager associated with my Connection ServiceDiscoveryManager discoManager = ServiceDiscoveryManager.getInstanceFor(connection); // Create a DiscoverItems with the items to publish DiscoverItems itemsToPublish = new DiscoverItems(); DiscoverItems.Item itemToPublish = new DiscoverItems.Item(\"pubsub.shakespeare.lit\"); itemToPublish.setName(\"Avatar\"); itemToPublish.setNode(\"romeo/avatar\"); itemToPublish.setAction(DiscoverItems.Item.UPDATE_ACTION); itemsToPublish.addItem(itemToPublish); // Publish the new items by sending them to the server discoManager.publishItems(\"host\", itemsToPublish);\n",
      "Send a entire roster Description Sometimes it is useful to send a whole roster to another user. Smack provides a very easy way to send a complete roster to another XMPP client. Usage Create an instance of RosterExchangeManager and use the #RosterExchangeManager.send(Roster, String) message to send a roster to a given user. The first parameter is the roster to send and the second parameter is the id of the user that will receive the roster entries. Example In this example we can see how user1 sends his roster to user2. // Connect to the server and log in conn1 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn1.login(server_user1, pass1); // Create a new roster exchange manager on conn1 RosterExchangeManager rosterExchangeManager = new RosterExchangeManager(conn1); // Send user1's roster to user2 rosterExchangeManager.send(conn1.getRoster(), user2);\n",
      "Send a roster group Description It is also possible to send a roster group to another XMPP client. A roster group groups a set of roster entries under a name. Usage Create an instance of RosterExchangeManager and use the #RosterExchangeManager.send(RosterGroup, String) message to send a roster group to a given user. The first parameter is the roster group to send and the second parameter is the id of the user that will receive the roster entries. Example In this example we can see how user1 sends his roster groups to user2. // Connect to the server and log in conn1 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn1.login(server_user1, pass1); // Create a new roster exchange manager on conn1 RosterExchangeManager rosterExchangeManager = new RosterExchangeManager(conn1); // Send user1's RosterGroups to user2 for (Iterator it = conn1.getRoster().getGroups(); it.hasNext(); ) rosterExchangeManager.send((RosterGroup)it.next(), user2);\n",
      "Send a roster entry Description Sometimes you may need to send a single roster entry to another XMPP client. Smack also lets you send items at this granularity level. Usage Create an instance of RosterExchangeManager and use the #RosterExchangeManager.send(RosterEntry, String) message to send a roster entry to a given user. The first parameter is the roster entry to send and the second parameter is the id of the user that will receive the roster entries. Example In this example we can see how user1 sends a roster entry to user2. // Connect to the server and log in conn1 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn1.login(server_user1, pass1); // Create a new roster exchange manager on conn1 RosterExchangeManager rosterExchangeManager = new RosterExchangeManager(conn1); // Send a roster entry (any) to user2 rosterExchangeManager1.send((RosterEntry)conn1.getRoster().getEntries().next(), user2);\n",
      "Receive roster entries Description Since roster items are sent between XMPP clients, it is necessary to listen to possible roster entries receptions. Smack provides a mechanism that you can use to execute custom logic when roster entries are received. Usage Create a class that implements the RosterExchangeListener interface. Implement the method RosterExchangeListener.entriesReceived(String, Iterator) that will be called when new entries are received with custom logic. Add the listener to the RosterExchangeManager that works on the desired Connection . Example In this example we can see how user1 sends a roster entry to user2 and user2 adds the received entries to his roster. // Connect to the server and log in the users conn1 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn1.login(server_user1, pass1); conn2 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn2.login(server_user2, pass2); final Roster user2_roster = conn2.getRoster(); // Create a RosterExchangeManager that will help user2 to listen and accept the entries received RosterExchangeManager rosterExchangeManager2 = new RosterExchangeManager(conn2); // Create a RosterExchangeListener that will iterate over the received roster entries RosterExchangeListener rosterExchangeListener = new RosterExchangeListener() { public void entriesReceived(String from, Iterator remoteRosterEntries) { while (remoteRosterEntries.hasNext()) { try { // Get the received entry RemoteRosterEntry remoteRosterEntry = (RemoteRosterEntry) remoteRosterEntries.next(); // Display the remote entry on the console System.out.println(remoteRosterEntry); // Add the entry to the user2's roster user2_roster.createEntry( remoteRosterEntry.getUser(), remoteRosterEntry.getName(), remoteRosterEntry.getGroupArrayNames()); } catch (XMPPException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } }; // Add the RosterExchangeListener to the RosterExchangeManager that user2 is using rosterExchangeManager2.addRosterListener(rosterExchangeListener); // Create a RosterExchangeManager that will help user1 to send his roster RosterExchangeManager rosterExchangeManager1 = new RosterExchangeManager(conn1); // Send user1's roster to user2 rosterExchangeManager1.send(conn1.getRoster(), user2);\n",
      "Roster and Presence The roster lets you keep track of the availability (\"presence\") of other users. A roster also allows you to organize users into groups such as \"Friends\" and \"Co-workers\". Other IM systems refer to the roster as the buddy list, contact list, etc. A Roster instance is obtained using the Connection.getRoster() method.\n",
      "Compose an XHTML Message - part 2 Create an instance of XHTMLText specifying the style and language of the body. You can add several XHTML bodies to the message but each body should be for a different language. Once you have an XHTMLText you can start to append tags and text to it. In order to append tags there are several messages that you can use. For each XHTML defined tag there is a message that you can send. In order to add text you can send the message #XHTMLText.append(String textToAppend) . After you have configured the XHTML text, the last step you have to do is to add the XHTML text to the message you want to send. If you decided to create the XHTML text by yourself, you will have to follow this last step too. In order to add the XHTML text to the message send the message #XHTMLManager.addBody(Message message, String body) to the XHTMLManager class where message is the message that will receive the XHTML body and body is the string to add as an XHTML body to the message.\n",
      "Send an XHTML Message Description After you have composed an XHTML message you will want to send it. Once you have added the XHTML content to the message you want to send you are almost done. The last step is to send the message as you do with any other message. Usage An XHTML message is like any regular message, therefore to send the message you can follow the usual steps you do in order to send a message. For example, to send a message as part of a chat just use the message #send(Message) of Chat or you can use the message #send(Packet) of Connection . Example In this example we can see how to send a message with XHTML content as part of a chat. // Create a message to send Message msg = chat.createMessage(); // Obtain the XHTML text to send from somewhere String xhtmlBody = getXHTMLTextToSend(); // Add the XHTML text to the message XHTMLManager.addBody(msg, xhtmlBody); // Send the message that contains the XHTML chat.sendMessage(msg);\n",
      "Receive an XHTML Message Description It is also possible to obtain the XHTML content from a received message. Remember that the specification defines that a message may contain several XHTML bodies where each body should be for a different language. Usage To get the XHTML bodies of a given message just send the message #XHTMLManager.getBodies(Message) to the class XHTMLManager . The answer of this message will be an Iterator with the different XHTML bodies of the message or null if none. Example In this example we can see how to create a PacketListener that obtains the XHTML bodies of any received message. // Create a listener for the chat and display any XHTML content PacketListener packetListener = new PacketListener() { public void processPacket(Packet packet) { Message message = (Message) packet; // Obtain the XHTML bodies of the message Iterator it = XHTMLManager.getBodies(message); if (it != null) { // Display the bodies on the console while (it.hasNext()) { String body = (String) it.next(); System.out.println(body); } } }; chat.addMessageListener(packetListener);\n",
      "Discover support for XHTML Messages Description Before you start to send XHTML messages to a user you should discover if the user supports XHTML messages. There are two ways to achieve the discovery, explicitly and implicitly. Explicit is when you first try to discover if the user supports XHTML before sending any XHTML message. Implicit is when you send XHTML messages without first discovering if the conversation partner's client supports XHTML and depenging on the answer (normal message or XHTML message) you find out if the user supports XHTML messages or not. This section explains how to explicitly discover for XHTML support. Usage In order to discover if a remote user supports XHTML messages send #XHTMLManager.isServiceEnabled(Connection connection, String userID) to the class XHTMLManager where connection is the connection to use to perform the service discovery and userID is the user to check (A fully qualified xmpp ID, e.g. jdoe@example.com). This message will return true if the specified user handles XHTML messages. Example In this example we can see how to discover if a remote user supports XHTML Messages. Message msg = chat.createMessage(); // Include a normal body in the message msg.setBody(getTextToSend()); // Check if the other user supports XHTML messages if (XHTMLManager.isServiceEnabled(connection, chat.getParticipant())) { // Obtain the XHTML text to send from somewhere String xhtmlBody = getXHTMLTextToSend(); // Include an XHTML body in the message XHTMLManager.addBody(msg, xhtmlBody); } // Send the message chat.sendMessage(msg);\n",
      "Create a new Room Description Allowed users may create new rooms. There are two types of rooms that you can create. Instant rooms which are available for immediate access and are automatically created based on some default configuration and Reserved rooms which are manually configured by the room creator before anyone is allowed to enter. Usage In order to create a room you will need to first create an instance of MultiUserChat . The room name passed to the constructor will be the name of the room to create. The next step is to send MultiUserChat.create(String nickname) to the MultiUserChat instance where nickname is the nickname to use when joining the room. Depending on the type of room that you want to create you will have to use different configuration forms. In order to create an Instant room just send MultiUserChat.sendConfigurationForm(Form form) where form is an empty form. But if you want to create a Reserved room then you should first get the room's configuration form, complete the form and finally send it back to the server.\n",
      "Join a room Description Your usual first step in order to send messages to a room is to join the room. Multi User Chat allows to specify several parameter while joining a room. Basically you can control the amount of history to receive after joining the room as well as provide your nickname within the room and a password if the room is password protected. Usage In order to join a room you will need to first create an instance of MultiUserChat . The room name passed to the constructor will be the name of the room to join. The next step is to send MultiUserChat.join(...) to the MultiUserChat instance. But first you will have to decide which join message to send. If you want to just join the room without a password and without specifying the amount of history to receive then you could use MultiUserChat.join(String nickname) where nickname if your nickname in the room. In case the room requires a password in order to join you could then use MultiUserChat.join(String nickname, String password) . And finally, the most complete way to join a room is to send MultiUserChat.join(String nickname, String password, DiscussionHistory history, long timeout) where nickname is your nickname in the room, , password is your password to join the room, history is an object that specifies the amount of history to receive and timeout is the milliseconds to wait for a response from the server.\n",
      "Manage room invitations Description It can be useful to invite another user to a room in which one is an occupant. Depending on the room's type the invitee could receive a password to use to join the room and/or be added to the member list if the room is of type members-only. Smack allows to send room invitations and let potential invitees to listening for room invitations and inviters to listen for invitees' rejections. Usage In order to invite another user to a room you must be already joined to the room. Once you are joined just send MultiUserChat.invite(String participant, String reason) to the MultiUserChat where participant is the user to invite to the room (e.g. hecate@shakespeare.lit) and reason is the reason why the user is being invited. If potential invitees want to listen for room invitations then the invitee must add an InvitationListener to the MultiUserChat class. Since the InvitationListener is an interface, it is necessary to create a class that implements this interface. If an inviter wants to listen for room invitation rejections, just add an InvitationRejectionListener to the MultiUserChat . InvitationRejectionListener is also an interface so you will need to create a class that implements this interface.\n",
      "Discover MUC support Description A user may want to discover if one of the user's contacts supports the Multi-User Chat protocol. Usage In order to discover if one of the user's contacts supports MUC just send MultiUserChat.isServiceEnabled(Connection connection, String user) to the MultiUserChat class where user is a fully qualified XMPP ID, e.g. jdoe@example.com. You will receive a boolean indicating whether the user supports MUC or not. Examples In this example we can see how to discover support of MUC: // Discover whether user3@host.org supports MUC or not boolean supports = MultiUserChat.isServiceEnabled(conn, \"user3@host.org/Smack\");\n",
      "Discover joined rooms Description A user may also want to query a contact regarding which rooms the contact is in. Usage In order to get the rooms where a user is in just send MultiUserChat.getJoinedRooms(Connection connection, String user) to the MultiUserChat class where user is a fully qualified XMPP ID, e.g. jdoe@example.com. You will get an Iterator of Strings as an answer where each String represents a room name. Examples In this example we can see how to get the rooms where a user is in: // Get the rooms where user3@host.org has joined Iterator joinedRooms = MultiUserChat.getJoinedRooms(conn, \"user3@host.org/Smack\");\n",
      "Discover room information Description A user may need to discover information about a room without having to actually join the room. The server will provide information only for public rooms. Usage In order to discover information about a room just send MultiUserChat.getRoomInfo(Connection connection, String room) to the MultiUserChat class where room is the XMPP ID of the room, e.g. roomName@conference.myserver. You will get a RoomInfo object that contains the discovered room information. Examples In this example we can see how to discover information about a room: // Discover information about the room roomName@conference.myserver RoomInfo info = MultiUserChat.getRoomInfo(conn, \"roomName@conference.myserver\"); System.out.println(\"Number of occupants:\" + info.getOccupantsCount()); System.out.println(\"Room Subject:\" + info.getSubject());\n",
      "Start a private chat Description A room occupant may want to start a private chat with another room occupant even though they don't know the fully qualified XMPP ID (e.g. jdoe@example.com) of each other. Usage To create a private chat with another room occupant just send MultiUserChat.createPrivateChat(String participant) to the MultiUserChat that you used to join the room. The parameter participant is the occupant unique room JID (e.g. 'darkcave@macbeth.shakespeare.lit/Paul'). You will receive a regular Chat object that you can use to chat with the other room occupant. Examples In this example we can see how to start a private chat with another room occupant: // Start a private chat with another participant Chat chat = muc2.createPrivateChat(\"myroom@conference.jabber.org/johndoe\"); chat.sendMessage(\"Hello there\");\n",
      "Manage changes on room subject Description A common feature of multi-user chat rooms is the ability to change the subject within the room. As a default, only users with a role of \"moderator\" are allowed to change the subject in a room. Although some rooms may be configured to allow a mere participant or even a visitor to change the subject. Every time the room's subject is changed you may want to be notified of the modification. The new subject could be used to display an in-room message. Usage In order to modify the room's subject just send MultiUserChat.changeSubject(String subject) to the MultiUserChat that you used to join the room where subject is the new room's subject. On the other hand, if you want to be notified whenever the room's subject is modified you should add a SubjectUpdatedListener to the MultiUserChat by sending MultiUserChat.addSubjectUpdatedListener(SubjectUpdatedListener listener) to the MultiUserChat . Since the SubjectUpdatedListener is an interface, it is necessary to create a class that implements this interface. Examples In this example we can see how to change the room's subject and react whenever the room's subject is modified: // An occupant wants to be notified every time the room's subject is changed muc3.addSubjectUpdatedListener(new SubjectUpdatedListener() { public void subjectUpdated(String subject, String from) { .... } }); // A room's owner changes the room's subject muc2.changeSubject(\"New Subject\");\n",
      "Manage role modifications - part 2 Usage In order to grant voice (i.e. make someone a participant) just send the message MultiUserChat.grantVoice(String nickname) to MultiUserChat . Use MultiUserChat.revokeVoice(String nickname) to revoke the occupant's voice (i.e. make the occupant a visitor). In order to grant moderator privileges to a participant or visitor just send the message MultiUserChat.grantModerator(String nickname) to MultiUserChat . Use MultiUserChat.revokeModerator(String nickname) to revoke the moderator privilege from the occupant thus making the occupant a participant. Smack allows you to listen for role modification events. If you are interested in listening role modification events of any occupant then use the listener ParticipantStatusListener . But if you are interested in listening for your own role modification events, use the listener UserStatusListener . Both listeners should be added to the MultiUserChat by using MultiUserChat.addParticipantStatusListener(ParticipantStatusListener listener) or MultiUserChat.addUserStatusListener(UserStatusListener listener) respectively. These listeners include several notification events but you may be interested in just a few of them. Smack provides default implementations for these listeners avoiding you to implement all the interfaces' methods. The default implementations are DefaultUserStatusListener and DefaultParticipantStatusListener . Below you will find the sent messages to the listeners whenever an occupant's role has changed.\n",
      "Manage affiliation modifications - part 2 The member affiliation provides a way for a room owner or admin to specify a \"whitelist\" of users who are allowed to enter a members-only room. When a member enters a members-only room, his or her affiliation does not change, no matter what his or her role is. The member affiliation also provides a way for users to effectively register with an open room and thus be permanently associated with that room in some way (one result may be that the user's nickname is reserved in the room). An outcast is a user who has been banned from a room and who is not allowed to enter the room. Whenever a user's affiliation is changed Smack will trigger specific events. Usage In order to grant membership to a room, administrator privileges or owner priveliges just send MultiUserChat.grantMembership(String jid) , MultiUserChat.grantAdmin(String jid) or MultiUserChat.grantOwnership(String jid) to MultiUserChat respectively. Use MultiUserChat.revokeMembership(String jid) , MultiUserChat.revokeAdmin(String jid) or MultiUserChat.revokeOwnership(String jid) to revoke the membership to a room, administrator privileges or owner priveliges respectively.\n",
      "Manage affiliation modifications - part 3 In order to ban a user from the room just send the message MultiUserChat.banUser(String jid, String reason) to MultiUserChat . Smack allows you to listen for affiliation modification events. If you are interested in listening affiliation modification events of any user then use the listener ParticipantStatusListener . But if you are interested in listening for your own affiliation modification events, use the listener UserStatusListener . Both listeners should be added to the MultiUserChat by using MultiUserChat.addParticipantStatusListener(ParticipantStatusListener listener) or MultiUserChat.addUserStatusListener(UserStatusListener listener) respectively. These listeners include several notification events but you may be interested in just a few of them. Smack provides default implementations for these listeners avoiding you to implement all the interfaces' methods. The default implementations are DefaultUserStatusListener and DefaultParticipantStatusListener . Below you will find the sent messages to the listeners whenever a user's affiliation has changed.\n",
      "Messaging using Chats Sending messages back and forth is at the core of instant messaging. Although individual messages can be sent and received as packets, it's generally easier to treat the string of messages as a chat using the org.jivesoftware.smack.Chat class.\n",
      "Requesting Event Notifications Description In order to receive event notifications for a given message you first have to specify which events are you interested in. Each message that you send has to request its own event notifications. Therefore, every message that you send as part of a chat should request its own event notifications. Usage The class MessageEventManager provides an easy way for requesting event notifications. All you have to do is specify the message that requires the event notifications and the events that you are interested in. Use the static method MessageEventManager.MessageEventManager.addNotificationsRequests(Message message, boolean offline, boolean delivered, boolean displayed, boolean composing) for requesting event notifications. Example Below you can find an example that logs in a user to the server, creates a message, adds the requests for notifications and sends the message. // Connect to the server and log in conn1 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn1.login(server_user1, pass1); // Create a chat with user2 Chat chat1 = conn1.createChat(user2); // Create a message to send Message msg = chat1.createMessage(); msg.setSubject(\"Any subject you want\"); msg.setBody(\"An interesting body comes here...\"); // Add to the message all the notifications requests (offline, delivered, displayed, // composing) MessageEventManager.addNotificationsRequests(msg, true, true, true, true); // Send the message that contains the notifications request chat1.sendMessage(msg);\n",
      "Reacting to Event Notification Requests Description You can receive notification requests for the following events: delivered, displayed, composing and offline. You must listen for these requests and react accordingly. Usage The general idea is to create a new DefaultMessageEventRequestListener that will listen to the event notifications requests and react with custom logic. Then you will have to add the listener to the MessageEventManager that works on the desired Connection . Note that DefaultMessageEventRequestListener is a default implementation of the MessageEventRequestListener interface. The class DefaultMessageEventRequestListener automatically sends a delivered notification to the sender of the message if the sender has requested to be notified when the message is delivered. If you decide to create a new class that implements the MessageEventRequestListener interface, please remember to send the delivered notification. To create a new MessageEventManager use the MessageEventManager.MessageEventManager(Connection) constructor. To create an event notification requests listener create a subclass of DefaultMessageEventRequestListener or create a class that implements the MessageEventRequestListener interface. To add a listener to the messageEventManager use the MessageEventManager's message MessageEventManager.addMessageEventRequestListener(MessageEventRequestListener) .\n",
      "Reacting to Event Notification Requests - part 2 Example Below you can find an example that connects two users to the server. One user will create a message, add the requests for notifications and will send the message to the other user. The other user will add a DefaultMessageEventRequestListener to a MessageEventManager that will listen and react to the event notification requested by the other user. // Connect to the server and log in the users conn1 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn1.login(server_user1, pass1); conn2 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn2.login(server_user2, pass2); // User2 creates a MessageEventManager MessageEventManager messageEventManager = new MessageEventManager(conn2); // User2 adds the listener that will react to the event notifications requests messageEventManager.addMessageEventRequestListener(new DefaultMessageEventRequestListener() { public void deliveredNotificationRequested( String from, String packetID, MessageEventManager messageEventManager) { super.deliveredNotificationRequested(from, packetID, messageEventManager); // DefaultMessageEventRequestListener automatically responds that the message was delivered when receives this request System.out.println(\"Delivered Notification Requested (\" + from + \", \" + packetID + \")\"); } public void displayedNotificationRequested( String from, String packetID, MessageEventManager messageEventManager) { super.displayedNotificationRequested(from, packetID, messageEventManager); // Send to the message's sender that the message was displayed messageEventManager.sendDisplayedNotification(from, packetID); } public void composingNotificationRequested( String from, String packetID, MessageEventManager messageEventManager) { super.composingNotificationRequested(from, packetID, messageEventManager); // Send to the message's sender that the message's receiver is composing a reply messageEventManager.sendComposingNotification(from, packetID); } public void offlineNotificationRequested( String from, String packetID, MessageEventManager messageEventManager) { super.offlineNotificationRequested(from, packetID, messageEventManager); // The XMPP server should take care of this request. Do nothing. System.out.println(\"Offline Notification Requested (\" + from + \", \" + packetID + \")\"); } }); // User1 creates a chat with user2 Chat chat1 = conn1.createChat(user2); // User1 creates a message to send to user2 Message msg = chat1.createMessage(); msg.setSubject(\"Any subject you want\"); msg.setBody(\"An interesting body comes here...\"); // User1 adds to the message all the notifications requests (offline, delivered, displayed, // composing) MessageEventManager.addNotificationsRequests(msg, true, true, true, true); // User1 sends the message that contains the notifications request chat1.sendMessage(msg); Thread.sleep(500); // User2 sends to the message's sender that the message's receiver cancelled composing a reply messageEventManager.sendCancelledNotification(user1, msg.getPacketID());\n",
      "Reacting to Event Notifications Description Once you have requested for event notifications you will start to receive notifications of events. You can receive notifications of the following events: delivered, displayed, composing, offline and cancelled. You will probably want to react to some or all of these events. Usage The general idea is to create a new MessageEventNotificationListener that will listen to the event notifications and react with custom logic. Then you will have to add the listener to the MessageEventManager that works on the desired Connection . To create a new MessageEventManager use the MessageEventManager.MessageEventManager(Connection) constructor. To create an event notifications listener create a class that implements the MessageEventNotificationListener interface. To add a listener to the messageEventManager use the MessageEventManager's message MessageEventManager.addMessageEventNotificationListener(MessageEventNotificationListener) . Example Below you can find an example that logs in a user to the server, adds a MessageEventNotificationListener to a MessageEventManager that will listen and react to the event notifications, creates a message, adds the requests for notifications and sends the message. // Connect to the server and log in conn1 = new XMPPConnection(host); conn1.login(server_user1, pass1); // Create a MessageEventManager MessageEventManager messageEventManager = new MessageEventManager(conn1); // Add the listener that will react to the event notifications messageEventManager.addMessageEventNotificationListener(new MessageEventNotificationListener() { public void deliveredNotification(String from, String packetID) { System.out.println(\"The message has been delivered (\" + from + \", \" + packetID + \")\"); } public void displayedNotification(String from, String packetID) { System.out.println(\"The message has been displayed (\" + from + \", \" + packetID + \")\"); } public void composingNotification(String from, String packetID) { System.out.println(\"The message's receiver is composing a reply (\" + from + \", \" + packetID + \")\"); } public void offlineNotification(String from, String packetID) { System.out.println(\"The message's receiver is offline (\" + from + \", \" + packetID + \")\"); } public void cancelledNotification(String from, String packetID) { System.out.println(\"The message's receiver cancelled composing a reply (\" + from + \", \" + packetID + \")\"); } }); // Create a chat with user2 Chat chat1 = conn1.createChat(user2); // Create a message to send Message msg = chat1.createMessage(); msg.setSubject(\"Any subject you want\"); msg.setBody(\"An interesting body comes here...\"); // Add to the message all the notifications requests (offline, delivered, displayed, // composing) MessageEventManager.addNotificationsRequests(msg, true, true, true, true); // Send the message that contains the notifications request chat1.sendMessage(msg);\n"

      "<p>A <i>collections framework</i> is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following:</p> \n",
      "<ul> \n",
      " <li><b>Interfaces:</b> These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.</li> \n",
      " <li><b>Implementations:</b> These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.</li> \n",
      " <li><b>Algorithms:</b> These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be <i>polymorphic</i>: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface. In essence, algorithms are reusable functionality.</li> \n",
      "</ul> \n",
      "<p>Apart from the Java Collections Framework, the best-known examples of collections frameworks are the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and Smalltalk's collection hierarchy. Historically, collections frameworks have been quite complex, which gave them a reputation for having a steep learning curve. We believe that the Java Collections Framework breaks with this tradition, as you will learn for yourself in this chapter.</p>\n",

      "   Collections \n",
      " </clt>Framework</h2> \n",
      "<p>The Java Collections Framework provides the following benefits:</p> \n",
      "<ul> \n",
      " <li><b>Reduces programming effort:</b> By providing useful data structures and algorithms, the Collections Framework frees you to concentrate on the important parts of your program rather than on the low-level &quot;plumbing&quot; required to make it work. By facilitating interoperability among unrelated APIs, the Java Collections Framework frees you from writing adapter objects or conversion code to connect APIs.</li> \n",
      " <li><b>Increases program speed and quality:</b> This Collections Framework provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms. The various implementations of each interface are interchangeable, so programs can be easily tuned by switching collection implementations. Because you're freed from the drudgery of writing your own data structures, you'll have more time to devote to improving programs' quality and performance.</li> \n",
      " <li><b>Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs:</b> The collection interfaces are the vernacular by which APIs pass collections back and forth. If my network administration API furnishes a collection of node names and if your GUI toolkit expects a collection of column headings, our APIs will interoperate seamlessly, even though they were written independently.</li> \n",
      " <li><b>Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs:</b> Many APIs naturally take collections on input and furnish them as output. In the past, each such API had a small sub-API devoted to manipulating its collections. There was little consistency among these ad hoc collections sub-APIs, so you had to learn each one from scratch, and it was easy to make mistakes when using them. With the advent of standard collection interfaces, the problem went away.</li> \n",
      " <li><b>Reduces effort to design new APIs:</b> This is the flip side of the previous advantage. Designers and implementers don't have to reinvent the wheel each time they create an API that relies on collections; instead, they can use standard collection interfaces.</li> \n",
      " <li><b>Fosters software reuse:</b> New data structures that conform to the standard collection interfaces are by nature reusable. The same goes for new algorithms that operate on objects that implement these interfaces.</li> \n",

      "Lesson: Algorithms The polymorphic algorithms described here are pieces of reusable functionality provided by the Java platform. All of them come from the Collections class, and all take the form of static methods whose first argument is the collection on which the operation is to be performed. The great majority of the algorithms provided by the Java platform operate on List instances, but a few of them operate on arbitrary Collection instances. This section briefly describes the following algorithms: Sorting Shuffling Routine Data Manipulation Searching Composition Finding Extreme Values\n",
      "Sorting The Collections.sort algorithm reorders a List so that its elements are in ascending order according to an ordering relationship. Two forms of the operation are provided. The simple form takes a List and sorts it according to its elements' natural ordering. If you're unfamiliar with the concept of natural ordering, read the Object Ordering section. The Collections.sort operation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithm that is fast and stable: Fast: It is guaranteed to run in n log(n) time and runs substantially faster on nearly sorted lists. Empirical tests showed it to be as fast as a highly optimized quicksort. A quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable and doesn't guarantee n log(n) performance. Stable: It doesn't reorder equal elements. This is important if you sort the same list repeatedly on different attributes. If a user of a mail program sorts the inbox by mailing date and then sorts it by sender, the user naturally expects that the now-contiguous list of messages from a given sender will (still) be sorted by mailing date. This is guaranteed only if the second sort was stable.\n",
      "Sorting - part 2 The following trivial program prints out its arguments in lexicographic (alphabetical) order. import java.util.*; public class Sort { public static void main(String[] args) { List<String> list = Arrays.asList(args); Collections.sort(list); System.out.println(list); } } Let's run the program. % java Sort i walk the line The following output is produced. [i, line, the, walk] The program was included only to show you that algorithms really are as easy to use as they appear to be. The second form of Collections.sort takes a Comparator in addition to a List and sorts the elements with the Comparator . Suppose you want to print out the anagram groups from our earlier example in reverse order of size ? largest anagram group first. The example that follows shows you how to achieve this with the help of the second form of the Collections.sort method.\n",
      "Sorting - part 3 Recall that the anagram groups are stored as values in a Map , in the form of List instances. The revised printing code iterates through the Map 's values view, putting every List that passes the minimum-size test into a List of List s. Then the code sorts this List , using a Comparator that expects List instances, and implements reverse size-ordering. Finally, the code iterates through the sorted List , printing its elements (the anagram groups). The following code replaces the printing code at the end of the main method in the Anagrams example. // Make a List of all anagram groups above size threshold. List<List<String>> winners = new ArrayList<List<String>>(); for (List<String> l : m.values()) if (l.size() >= minGroupSize) winners.add(l); // Sort anagram groups according to size Collections.sort(winners, new Comparator<List<String>>() { public int compare(List<String> o1, List<String> o2) { return o2.size() - o1.size(); }}); // Print anagram groups. for (List<String> l : winners) System.out.println(l.size() + \": \" + l); Running the program on the same dictionary as in The Map Interface section, with the same minimum anagram group size (eight), produces the following output. 12: [apers, apres, asper, pares, parse, pears, prase, presa, rapes, reaps, spare, spear] 11: [alerts, alters, artels, estral, laster, ratels, salter, slater, staler, stelar, talers] 10: [least, setal, slate, stale, steal, stela, taels, tales, teals, tesla] 9: [estrin, inerts, insert, inters, niters, nitres, sinter, triens, trines] 9: [capers, crapes, escarp, pacers, parsec, recaps, scrape, secpar, spacer] 9: [palest, palets, pastel, petals, plates, pleats, septal, staple, tepals] 9: [anestri, antsier, nastier, ratines, retains, retinas, retsina, stainer, stearin] 8: [lapse, leaps, pales, peals, pleas, salep, sepal, spale] 8: [aspers, parses, passer, prases, repass, spares, sparse, spears] 8: [enters, nester, renest, rentes, resent, tenser, ternes,treens] 8: [arles, earls, lares, laser, lears, rales, reals, seral] 8: [earings, erasing, gainers, reagins, regains, reginas, searing, seringa] 8: [peris, piers, pries, prise, ripes, speir, spier, spire] 8: [ates, east, eats, etas, sate, seat, seta, teas] 8: [carets, cartes, caster, caters, crates, reacts, recast,traces]\n"
